      "Description: Many people in all walks of life experience drug and alcohol problems that limit their ability to fully enjoy life and also harm their family and friends. People are reluctant to address these difficulties even with their closest friends and family members. Many times they are not even aware that the problems exist or do not recognize the symptoms. Here at Whiteside Manor, trained drug and alcohol intervention staff are available to help coax your loved one into treatment.When a person is affected by both psychiatric illness and chemical dependency, they are suffering from co-occurring conditions, known as Dual Diagnosis. Psychiatric illness and chemical dependency impact an individual physically, psychologically, socially and spiritually. Whiteside Manor offers a residential treatment program that is centered on the complete individual. Our Dual Diagnosis services focus on mental health recovery and addiction recovery issues that may be afflicting an individual. The primary presenting problem of those we serve is specifically substance abuse with a mental disorder/ illness secondary. Services include therapy groups made up of similarly situated, dually diagnosed clients. Groups are low-impact, highly supportive and non-confrontational. Psychiatric services are provided as well as medication monitoring and management. Clients learn about their dual disorders and also the symptoms and techniques for relapse prevention for both disorders.This program provides:- Residential treatment- Counseling- Addiction services- Mental health care\n",

CFRI will cover the cost of your insurance co-pay for six sessions, or pay up to $120 per session for six sessions if you have no insurance, or your provider does not accept insurance or is outside of your network.You can select a licensed therapist in your community (for a referral, you can ask your CF social worker).This program has limited funds and operates on a “first come first serve” basis. Due to high demand, the program often runs out of funding in the second half of the year. To ensure that your sessions are covered, please follow CFRI program procedures as outlined below:- Check in with CFRI staff: BEFORE sending us any invoices, contracts, or other documents, please contact Sabine Brants ([email protected], 650-665-7576) to check if there is funding available for your sessions. If CFRI has funding available, CFRI staff will send the required paperwork to you as well as your chosen provider. The paperwork provided to you needs to be completed BEFORE starting CFRI-supported sessions. - Wait for sessions to be approved: Once CFRI receives the completed paperwork from you and the provider, CFRI staff will let you know that you are approved to start your six CFRI-supported sessions. This program will not accept invoices that are submitted without prior approval.- Submit assessments and invoices: By participating in the program, you commit to take part in the brief evaluation process. At the first and last of the CFRI-supported sessions, the therapist will ask you to complete two short questionnaires, and submit them to CFRI along with the first and last invoice. Please notify CFRI immediately if you discontinue therapy for whatever reason so the money can be released and used to support other people with CF and their families.For more information on how to participate in CFRI’s Counseling Support Program, please email Sabine Brants: [email protected].\n",

We can help you get information about mental health, services at the VA and tips on how to begin the conversation about treatment with a loved one who is a Veteran.What to expect: When you call Coaching Into Care at 888-823-7458, you will talk with a member of our team who specializes in helping callers determine the best way to help the Veteran they care about and how to navigate the VA system.

Our work with you may extend for several calls and usually with the same coach.Coaching Into Care takes your privacy, and that of the Veteran, very seriously.

NCCS strongly believes in evidence-based advocacy that reflects the needs of cancer patients to effect policy change at the national level.Survivorship is the challenge faced daily by millions of Americans who have a history of cancer. Survivorship, however, is not just about long-term survival. Instead, it is about one’s quality of life from diagnosis onward. It is living with, through, and beyond cancer.Remaining Hopeful presents a publication, \"You Have the Right to Remain Hopeful\" in order to provide general information and to serve as a resource for people experiencing a diagnosis of cancer. This resources represents the opinions of NCCS and is not designed to provide individual advice nor substitute for professional counsel. The publication addresses the following topics: • Cancer as a crisis• Cancer and fear• Remaining positive • Family hope • Hoping for health care professionalsIt is important to think about your own hoping strategies and to be direct with family, friends and professional caregivers about what is most helpful to you with regard to using and maintaining hope. Never let anyone tell you that there is nothing further to hope for or that there is no hope. There is always something to hope for, and you, as an individual, have the right to determine for what, when and how you hope.\n",
