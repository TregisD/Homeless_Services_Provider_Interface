CFRI will cover the cost of your insurance co-pay for six sessions, or pay up to $120 per session for six sessions if you have no insurance, or your provider does not accept insurance or is outside of your network.You can select a licensed therapist in your community (for a referral, you can ask your CF social worker).This program has limited funds and operates on a “first come first serve” basis. Due to high demand, the program often runs out of funding in the second half of the year. To ensure that your sessions are covered, please follow CFRI program procedures as outlined below:- Check in with CFRI staff: BEFORE sending us any invoices, contracts, or other documents, please contact Sabine Brants ([email protected], 650-665-7576) to check if there is funding available for your sessions. If CFRI has funding available, CFRI staff will send the required paperwork to you as well as your chosen provider. The paperwork provided to you needs to be completed BEFORE starting CFRI-supported sessions. - Wait for sessions to be approved: Once CFRI receives the completed paperwork from you and the provider, CFRI staff will let you know that you are approved to start your six CFRI-supported sessions. This program will not accept invoices that are submitted without prior approval.- Submit assessments and invoices: By participating in the program, you commit to take part in the brief evaluation process. At the first and last of the CFRI-supported sessions, the therapist will ask you to complete two short questionnaires, and submit them to CFRI along with the first and last invoice. Please notify CFRI immediately if you discontinue therapy for whatever reason so the money can be released and used to support other people with CF and their families.For more information on how to participate in CFRI’s Counseling Support Program, please email Sabine Brants: [email protected].\n",

NCCS strongly believes in evidence-based advocacy that reflects the needs of cancer patients to effect policy change at the national level.Survivorship is the challenge faced daily by millions of Americans who have a history of cancer. Survivorship, however, is not just about long-term survival. Instead, it is about one’s quality of life from diagnosis onward. It is living with, through, and beyond cancer.Remaining Hopeful presents a publication, \"You Have the Right to Remain Hopeful\" in order to provide general information and to serve as a resource for people experiencing a diagnosis of cancer. This resources represents the opinions of NCCS and is not designed to provide individual advice nor substitute for professional counsel. The publication addresses the following topics: • Cancer as a crisis• Cancer and fear• Remaining positive • Family hope • Hoping for health care professionalsIt is important to think about your own hoping strategies and to be direct with family, friends and professional caregivers about what is most helpful to you with regard to using and maintaining hope. Never let anyone tell you that there is nothing further to hope for or that there is no hope. There is always something to hope for, and you, as an individual, have the right to determine for what, when and how you hope.\n",

      "Description: Jeremy Frank & Associates believes counseling is a collaborative process where clients sort out their thoughts and feelings in order to get a better understanding of who they are. Counseling is completely different from person to person. One client may want more advice or suggestions. Another might want mostly to vent and to be heard. Still others may need to be challenged or confronted. In general, though, most therapists believe that counseling helps us understand thoughts and feelings about ourselves that we have not previously fully recognized. Sigmund Freud referred to this process as making that which is unconscious conscious. I trust that clients know deep down what should be talked about in therapy and that they mostly need help knowing how to access these thoughts and feelings in order to realize what it is they want and need form others and their lives.Jeremy Frank & Associates' approach is eclectic or integrative, but we use many psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches in my work. I am open to sharing my personal thoughts and experiences as a way of helping others. I find that it often helps patients to know that their therapist is a human being too and much can be learned from the relationship of therapy. Many clients come to a therapist's office because they are struggling in their relationships. Paying attention to how your relationship develops in the office can help you understand how the really important social interactions in your life outside of the therapeutic relationship actually works.In some instances Jeremy Frank & Associates can provide services on a sliding fee scale depending on how many patients they currently have. There are several sliding fee scale spots, so please don't hesitate to inquire about availability.\n",

Our goal is to help Veterans, their family members, and other loved ones find the appropriate services at their local VA facilities and/or in their community. We also provide coaching to family and friends of Veterans who see that a Veteran in their life may be having difficulty adjusting to civilian life. Coaching is provided by licensed psychologists or social workers, free-of-charge. Coaching involves helping our callers figure out how to motivate the Veteran to seek treatment. We can help you get information about mental health, services at the VA and tips on how to begin the conversation about treatment with a loved one who is a Veteran.What to expect: When you call Coaching Into Care at 888-823-7458, you will talk with a member of our team who specializes in helping callers determine the best way to help the Veteran they care about and how to navigate the VA system. Our hours of operation are Monday — Friday, from 8 AM to 8 PM (Eastern).Calls with a coach vary in length, but generally take 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the issue. Our work with you may extend for several calls and usually with the same coach.Coaching Into Care takes your privacy, and that of the Veteran, very seriously. We keep all calls confidential, except for cases in which we act to protect the lives of you, the Veteran, or others.\n",

Each team will meet via Skype a minimum of every six (6) weeks post-journey for one year. Each team member is expected to commit to his or her team to support one another and be there for one another to help with transitioning back to civilian life. This is an extremely emotional journey, and the processing post-journey is critical. Team members must work together. All participants are expected to refrain from alcohol and, of course, recreational drugs throughout the journey. Participants must agree to give Heroes to Heroes a $520.00 refundable deposit (refunded on return to US ).The only cost to participants is for a U.S. Passport (must have an expiration date of six months or more post-journey), airfare to meet the team at the U.S. point of departure to Israel (usually either EWR (Newark Liberty, NJ), JFK, or LAX), and money for incidentals such as gifts and souvenirs.\n",

In addition, the residents of the Halfway House are supported through Case Management and Computer Lab services with resume building, on-line and in-person employment application, interview skills, college/trade school enrollment, money management/budgeting, establishing savings accounts, and addressing legal concerns.  Of greatest importance is maintaining the established in-house recovery support network and gradually extending this into the larger non-treatment community through 12 Step Fellowship meeting attendance, faith-based community worship, social visits with family and sober friends.  In doing so, the goal of the Halfway House is to prepare the individual to successfully and charitably manage the affairs of his daily living without the use of alcohol and other drugs.\n",

We offer: - Educational groups- Peer Support- Health, Wellness, and Faith-Based services- Community-based Support and Learning- Individual Therapy and Crisis Support- Group Therapy- Psychiatry (Medication Management)- Co-occurring (Mental Health and Drug & Alcohol) Support- Optional Older Adult ProgramOur ultimate goal is to help a person understand that they are a valued and needed part of society. No person’s recovery journey is the same, therefore there is no standard timeframe on REC services. Scheduling is choice-driven; members choose from the “menu” of services for the days, times, and activities that best fit their personal needs. The Older Adult Program is open on Saturdays, as well.Once a person completes the REC program they are welcome to transition to our Mental Health Outpatient program. If a person wishes to attend REC, they are able to do so right away; there is no waiting time for starting REC services.We accept Medicaid insurance for all of our REC services.\n",

Founded by and for cancer survivors, NCCS is a leader in advocating for policy changes that promote quality of care and quality of life after diagnosis. NCCS strongly believes in evidence-based advocacy that reflects the needs of cancer patients to effect policy change at the national level.Survivorship is the challenge faced daily by millions of Americans who have a history of cancer. Survivorship, however, is not just about long-term survival. Instead, it is about one’s quality of life from diagnosis onward. It is living with, through, and beyond cancer.Remaining Hopeful presents a publication, \"You Have the Right to Remain Hopeful\" in order to provide general information and to serve as a resource for people experiencing a diagnosis of cancer. This resources represents the opinions of NCCS and is not designed to provide individual advice nor substitute for professional counsel. The publication addresses the following topics: • Cancer as a crisis• Cancer and fear• Remaining positive • Family hope • Hoping for health care professionalsIt is important to think about your own hoping strategies and to be direct with family, friends and professional caregivers about what is most helpful to you with regard to using and maintaining hope. Never let anyone tell you that there is nothing further to hope for or that there is no hope. There is always something to hope for, and you, as an individual, have the right to determine for what, when and how you hope.\n",

Our goal is to help Veterans, their family members, and other loved ones find the appropriate services at their local VA facilities and/or in their community. We also provide coaching to family and friends of Veterans who see that a Veteran in their life may be having difficulty adjusting to civilian life. Coaching is provided by licensed psychologists or social workers, free-of-charge. Coaching involves helping our callers figure out how to motivate the Veteran to seek treatment. We can help you get information about mental health, services at the VA and tips on how to begin the conversation about treatment with a loved one who is a Veteran.What to expect: When you call Coaching Into Care at 888-823-7458, you will talk with a member of our team who specializes in helping callers determine the best way to help the Veteran they care about and how to navigate the VA system. Our hours of operation are Monday — Friday, from 8 AM to 8 PM (Eastern).Calls with a coach vary in length, but generally take 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the issue. Our work with you may extend for several calls and usually with the same coach.Coaching Into Care takes your privacy, and that of the Veteran, very seriously. We keep all calls confidential, except for cases in which we act to protect the lives of you, the Veteran, or others.\n",

This program emphasizes a family atmosphere, encouraging independent growth, personal accountability, and responsible community living.  Our residents continue their individual journey of recovery in a live in/ work out environment, with the support and structure of staff and peers to provide an opportunity for continued success. In addition, the residents of the Halfway House are supported through Case Management and Computer Lab services with resume building, on-line and in-person employment application, interview skills, college/trade school enrollment, money management/budgeting, establishing savings accounts, and addressing legal concerns.  Of greatest importance is maintaining the established in-house recovery support network and gradually extending this into the larger non-treatment community through 12 Step Fellowship meeting attendance, faith-based community worship, social visits with family and sober friends.  In doing so, the goal of the Halfway House is to prepare the individual to successfully and charitably manage the affairs of his daily living without the use of alcohol and other drugs.\n",

      "Description: Jeremy Frank & Associates believes counseling is a collaborative process where clients sort out their thoughts and feelings in order to get a better understanding of who they are. Counseling is completely different from person to person. One client may want more advice or suggestions. Another might want mostly to vent and to be heard. Still others may need to be challenged or confronted. In general, though, most therapists believe that counseling helps us understand thoughts and feelings about ourselves that we have not previously fully recognized. Sigmund Freud referred to this process as making that which is unconscious conscious. I trust that clients know deep down what should be talked about in therapy and that they mostly need help knowing how to access these thoughts and feelings in order to realize what it is they want and need form others and their lives.Jeremy Frank & Associates' approach is eclectic or integrative, but we use many psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches in my work. I am open to sharing my personal thoughts and experiences as a way of helping others. I find that it often helps patients to know that their therapist is a human being too and much can be learned from the relationship of therapy. Many clients come to a therapist's office because they are struggling in their relationships. Paying attention to how your relationship develops in the office can help you understand how the really important social interactions in your life outside of the therapeutic relationship actually works.In some instances Jeremy Frank & Associates can provide services on a sliding fee scale depending on how many patients they currently have. There are several sliding fee scale spots, so please don't hesitate to inquire about availability.\n",

Through the counseling support program, participants will be provided the guidance, expertise, and support thanks to the help of well versed licensed therapists who understand CF.This program provides:- Individual and family counselingChildren and adults with CF as well as their family members (parents, siblings, spouses/partners) are eligible to receive financial support for six individual therapy sessions per year with a licensed provider of their choice. CFRI will cover the cost of your insurance co-pay for six sessions, or pay up to $120 per session for six sessions if you have no insurance, or your provider does not accept insurance or is outside of your network.You can select a licensed therapist in your community (for a referral, you can ask your CF social worker).This program has limited funds and operates on a “first come first serve” basis. Due to high demand, the program often runs out of funding in the second half of the year. To ensure that your sessions are covered, please follow CFRI program procedures as outlined below:- Check in with CFRI staff: BEFORE sending us any invoices, contracts, or other documents, please contact Sabine Brants ([email protected], 650-665-7576) to check if there is funding available for your sessions. If CFRI has funding available, CFRI staff will send the required paperwork to you as well as your chosen provider. The paperwork provided to you needs to be completed BEFORE starting CFRI-supported sessions. - Wait for sessions to be approved: Once CFRI receives the completed paperwork from you and the provider, CFRI staff will let you know that you are approved to start your six CFRI-supported sessions. This program will not accept invoices that are submitted without prior approval.- Submit assessments and invoices: By participating in the program, you commit to take part in the brief evaluation process. At the first and last of the CFRI-supported sessions, the therapist will ask you to complete two short questionnaires, and submit them to CFRI along with the first and last invoice. Please notify CFRI immediately if you discontinue therapy for whatever reason so the money can be released and used to support other people with CF and their families.For more information on how to participate in CFRI’s Counseling Support Program, please email Sabine Brants: [email protected].\n",

Some focus on listening and validating, while others focus on reframing situations or solving problems. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to life. The core of peer counseling is that the relationship is based on shared experience, rather than diagnosing and treating a mental illness. We’re open and transparent about the challenges we’ve faced, so you can find someone who can relate.\n",

Due to high demand, the program often runs out of funding in the second half of the year. To ensure that your sessions are covered, please follow CFRI program procedures as outlined below:- Check in with CFRI staff: BEFORE sending us any invoices, contracts, or other documents, please contact Sabine Brants ([email protected], 650-665-7576) to check if there is funding available for your sessions. If CFRI has funding available, CFRI staff will send the required paperwork to you as well as your chosen provider. The paperwork provided to you needs to be completed BEFORE starting CFRI-supported sessions. - Wait for sessions to be approved: Once CFRI receives the completed paperwork from you and the provider, CFRI staff will let you know that you are approved to start your six CFRI-supported sessions. This program will not accept invoices that are submitted without prior approval.- Submit assessments and invoices: By participating in the program, you commit to take part in the brief evaluation process. At the first and last of the CFRI-supported sessions, the therapist will ask you to complete two short questionnaires, and submit them to CFRI along with the first and last invoice. Please notify CFRI immediately if you discontinue therapy for whatever reason so the money can be released and used to support other people with CF and their families.For more information on how to participate in CFRI’s Counseling Support Program, please email Sabine Brants: [email protected].\n",

      "Description: Coaching Into Care is a national telephone service of the U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA) which aims to educate, support, and empower family members and friends who are seeking care or services for a Veteran. Our goal is to help Veterans, their family members, and other loved ones find the appropriate services at their local VA facilities and/or in their community. We also provide coaching to family and friends of Veterans who see that a Veteran in their life may be having difficulty adjusting to civilian life. Coaching is provided by licensed psychologists or social workers, free-of-charge. Coaching involves helping our callers figure out how to motivate the Veteran to seek treatment. We can help you get information about mental health, services at the VA and tips on how to begin the conversation about treatment with a loved one who is a Veteran.What to expect: When you call Coaching Into Care at 888-823-7458, you will talk with a member of our team who specializes in helping callers determine the best way to help the Veteran they care about and how to navigate the VA system. Our hours of operation are Monday — Friday, from 8 AM to 8 PM (Eastern).Calls with a coach vary in length, but generally take 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the issue. Our work with you may extend for several calls and usually with the same coach.Coaching Into Care takes your privacy, and that of the Veteran, very seriously. We keep all calls confidential, except for cases in which we act to protect the lives of you, the Veteran, or others.\n",

NCCS strongly believes in evidence-based advocacy that reflects the needs of cancer patients to effect policy change at the national level.Survivorship is the challenge faced daily by millions of Americans who have a history of cancer. Survivorship, however, is not just about long-term survival. Instead, it is about one’s quality of life from diagnosis onward. It is living with, through, and beyond cancer.Remaining Hopeful presents a publication, \"You Have the Right to Remain Hopeful\" in order to provide general information and to serve as a resource for people experiencing a diagnosis of cancer. This resources represents the opinions of NCCS and is not designed to provide individual advice nor substitute for professional counsel. The publication addresses the following topics: • Cancer as a crisis• Cancer and fear• Remaining positive • Family hope • Hoping for health care professionalsIt is important to think about your own hoping strategies and to be direct with family, friends and professional caregivers about what is most helpful to you with regard to using and maintaining hope. Never let anyone tell you that there is nothing further to hope for or that there is no hope. There is always something to hope for, and you, as an individual, have the right to determine for what, when and how you hope.\n",
