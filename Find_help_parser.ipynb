      "Description: Coaching Into Care is a national telephone service of the U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA) which aims to educate, support, and empower family members and friends who are seeking care or services for a Veteran. Our goal is to help Veterans, their family members, and other loved ones find the appropriate services at their local VA facilities and/or in their community. We also provide coaching to family and friends of Veterans who see that a Veteran in their life may be having difficulty adjusting to civilian life. Coaching is provided by licensed psychologists or social workers, free-of-charge. Coaching involves helping our callers figure out how to motivate the Veteran to seek treatment. We can help you get information about mental health, services at the VA and tips on how to begin the conversation about treatment with a loved one who is a Veteran.What to expect: When you call Coaching Into Care at 888-823-7458, you will talk with a member of our team who specializes in helping callers determine the best way to help the Veteran they care about and how to navigate the VA system. Our hours of operation are Monday — Friday, from 8 AM to 8 PM (Eastern).Calls with a coach vary in length, but generally take 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the issue. Our work with you may extend for several calls and usually with the same coach.Coaching Into Care takes your privacy, and that of the Veteran, very seriously. We keep all calls confidential, except for cases in which we act to protect the lives of you, the Veteran, or others.\n",

Stepped care requires treatments of differing intensity. Thus, stepped interventions offer a variety of treatment options to match the intensity of the client's presenting problem as well as potential client preference. \n",

Kathy saw a need in the community for a substance abuse counseling service and took up the challenge to work with those who needed help.  Through The Business Connection, random drug testing is provided for the Department of Health Care Services and to employers which in turn, helps keep  their cost down and income up due to less absenteeism because of substance use.Anger Management:There are times when anger becomes out of control and private patients will often come to MELA to learn how they can learn ways to control their anger.

      "Description: Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) focus on evidence-based services, education, support and outreach to help inform and identify those who may be affected by some level of mental health issue. Mental Health services offered under the PEI plan are deeply rooted in the various Evidence Based Practice treatment models, and are provided with a strong emphasis on fidelity to the model, which requires participation in many weeks/months of consultation calls with the developers or their identified representatives. The focus of early intervention services is to avoid the need for more extensive mental health treatment, or prevent the mental health problem from becoming worse. Various Evidence Based Services focus on specific age groups covering the life span from young children to older adults. Under Alma Family Services’ Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) programs, efforts are made to increase prevention efforts and response to early signs of emotional and behavioral health problems among at-risk individuals. Providing mental health education, outreach and early identification (prior to diagnosis) can mitigate costly negative long-term outcomes for mental health clients and their families.Evidence Based Practices Offered at Alma Family Services:- Parent Child Interactive Therapy (PCIT)- Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS)- Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)- Managing and Adapting Practice (MAP)- Seeking Safety- Problem Solving Therapy (PST)- Mental Health Integration Program (MHIP)- Crisis Oriented Recovery Services (CORS)- Program to Encourage Active, Rewarding Lives for Seniors (PEARLS)- Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)\n",

KYCC’s programs and services are directed toward recently immigrated, economically disadvantaged youth and families, and promote community socioeconomic empowerment.At KYCC our goal is to provide a broad continuum of high quality and culturally relevant clinical services for low-income children, youth and their families. Many of our clients are unserved or underserved from a lack of culturally or linguistically relevant services. We offer short-term programs, help clients transition into recovery, and serve participants who may be beyond the scope of traditional outpatient services. We also provide medication management, individual and family-based case management, child abuse prevention and intervention, and parenting education.Prevention & Early Intervention Services provide individuals ages 0-15, short-term early mental health services that utilize evidence-based treatment models to minimize chronic mental health system involvement.  In order to receive service you must speak with an Intake Counselor (English, Korean, or Spanish available). The Intake Counselor will then screen you for eligibility. You will then be added to the waitlist or referred to another organization.\n",

      "Description: The G.U.Y.S. Program is a health education/risk reduction intervention designed to reduce high-risk sexual and drug behaviors among substance-using gay men and non-gay identified men who have sex with men, with women, and with transgender women.  The program provides a continuum of culturally appropriate services from street-based outreach encounters to site-based groups and one-on-one interventions that work concomitantly to motivate ongoing and sustained HIV risk reductions. Most specifically the intervention targets sexual risk behaviors that are most likely to occur while using methamphetamine, particularly unprotected anal intercourse as well as exchange sex risks and injection drug risks.The program offers a daily meal as well as a daily group. Program participants contribute art, poetry and prose to our street-based ‘zine, Twacked: A ‘Zine from the Guys of the Boulevard created and published by Friends Community Center. Our experience using art with active users has demonstrated that hands-on art exploration provides an opportunity for participants to closely identify their feelings and work toward better understanding their high-risk behaviors.\n",

BIH clients participate in weekly group sessions (10 prenatal and 10 postpartum) designed to help them access their own strengths and set health-promoting goals for themselves and their babies. In addition to helping clients reinforce the skills and knowledge they develop in the group sessions, one-on-one case management ensures that clients are connected with the appropriate community and social services to meet their needs.

Through the counseling support program, participants will be provided the guidance, expertise, and support thanks to the help of well versed licensed therapists who understand CF.This program provides:- Individual and family counselingChildren and adults with CF as well as their family members (parents, siblings, spouses/partners) are eligible to receive financial support for six individual therapy sessions per year with a licensed provider of their choice. CFRI will cover the cost of your insurance co-pay for six sessions, or pay up to $120 per session for six sessions if you have no insurance, or your provider does not accept insurance or is outside of your network.You can select a licensed therapist in your community (for a referral, you can ask your CF social worker).This program has limited funds and operates on a “first come first serve” basis. Due to high demand, the program often runs out of funding in the second half of the year. To ensure that your sessions are covered, please follow CFRI program procedures as outlined below:- Check in with CFRI staff: BEFORE sending us any invoices, contracts, or other documents, please contact Sabine Brants ([email protected], 650-665-7576) to check if there is funding available for your sessions. If CFRI has funding available, CFRI staff will send the required paperwork to you as well as your chosen provider. The paperwork provided to you needs to be completed BEFORE starting CFRI-supported sessions. - Wait for sessions to be approved: Once CFRI receives the completed paperwork from you and the provider, CFRI staff will let you know that you are approved to start your six CFRI-supported sessions. This program will not accept invoices that are submitted without prior approval.- Submit assessments and invoices: By participating in the program, you commit to take part in the brief evaluation process. At the first and last of the CFRI-supported sessions, the therapist will ask you to complete two short questionnaires, and submit them to CFRI along with the first and last invoice. Please notify CFRI immediately if you discontinue therapy for whatever reason so the money can be released and used to support other people with CF and their families.For more information on how to participate in CFRI’s Counseling Support Program, please email Sabine Brants: [email protected].\n",
