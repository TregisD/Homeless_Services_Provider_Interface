Since its early days as a food pantry, FISH has continued to evolve and expand services to meet the growing needs of its West Valley community.  While, most food pantries only allow recipients to get food once a month, at FISH, our recipients can return each week to receive a healthy assortment of food customized to their family size and needs. FISH also delivers food to seniors and others unable to leave their homes. FISH also provides pet food, diapers, clothing, and hygiene products when available.As a resource center, FISH also helps connect recipients to the services they need, from legal help, safe parking, and a path to permanent housing. FISH also works closely with partner organization, About My Father's Business, who through their street outreach program, provide resources directly to those in the unhoused community.   In addition, FISH also partners with other nonprofit organizations, such as Little Angels Project and VIDA Mobile Clinic to provide additional services to their community.\n",
