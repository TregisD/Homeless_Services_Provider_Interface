Through the counseling support program, participants will be provided the guidance, expertise, and support thanks to the help of well versed licensed therapists who understand CF.This program provides:- Individual and family counselingChildren and adults with CF as well as their family members (parents, siblings, spouses/partners) are eligible to receive financial support for six individual therapy sessions per year with a licensed provider of their choice. CFRI will cover the cost of your insurance co-pay for six sessions, or pay up to $120 per session for six sessions if you have no insurance, or your provider does not accept insurance or is outside of your network.You can select a licensed therapist in your community (for a referral, you can ask your CF social worker).This program has limited funds and operates on a “first come first serve” basis. Due to high demand, the program often runs out of funding in the second half of the year. To ensure that your sessions are covered, please follow CFRI program procedures as outlined below:- Check in with CFRI staff: BEFORE sending us any invoices, contracts, or other documents, please contact Sabine Brants ([email protected], 650-665-7576) to check if there is funding available for your sessions. If CFRI has funding available, CFRI staff will send the required paperwork to you as well as your chosen provider. The paperwork provided to you needs to be completed BEFORE starting CFRI-supported sessions. - Wait for sessions to be approved: Once CFRI receives the completed paperwork from you and the provider, CFRI staff will let you know that you are approved to start your six CFRI-supported sessions. This program will not accept invoices that are submitted without prior approval.- Submit assessments and invoices: By participating in the program, you commit to take part in the brief evaluation process. At the first and last of the CFRI-supported sessions, the therapist will ask you to complete two short questionnaires, and submit them to CFRI along with the first and last invoice. Please notify CFRI immediately if you discontinue therapy for whatever reason so the money can be released and used to support other people with CF and their families.For more information on how to participate in CFRI’s Counseling Support Program, please email Sabine Brants: [email protected].\n",

Our goal is to help Veterans, their family members, and other loved ones find the appropriate services at their local VA facilities and/or in their community. We also provide coaching to family and friends of Veterans who see that a Veteran in their life may be having difficulty adjusting to civilian life. Coaching is provided by licensed psychologists or social workers, free-of-charge. Coaching involves helping our callers figure out how to motivate the Veteran to seek treatment. We can help you get information about mental health, services at the VA and tips on how to begin the conversation about treatment with a loved one who is a Veteran.What to expect: When you call Coaching Into Care at 888-823-7458, you will talk with a member of our team who specializes in helping callers determine the best way to help the Veteran they care about and how to navigate the VA system. Our hours of operation are Monday — Friday, from 8 AM to 8 PM (Eastern).Calls with a coach vary in length, but generally take 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the issue. Our work with you may extend for several calls and usually with the same coach.Coaching Into Care takes your privacy, and that of the Veteran, very seriously. We keep all calls confidential, except for cases in which we act to protect the lives of you, the Veteran, or others.\n",

Some focus on listening and validating, while others focus on reframing situations or solving problems. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to life. The core of peer counseling is that the relationship is based on shared experience, rather than diagnosing and treating a mental illness. We’re open and transparent about the challenges we’ve faced, so you can find someone who can relate.\n",

      "Description: WHAT IS PC-CARE?\n",
      "Parent-Child Care (PC-CARE) is a 6 session dyadic treatment program for families that are interested in improving caregiver-child relationships and are willing to learn new child behavior management strategies. It serves families with children ages 1 to 10 years. A wide range of caregivers can participate, including biological parents, foster and kin caregivers, and adoptive caregivers. PC-CARE can be provided by mental health clinicians as a mental health intervention, and paraprofessionals as a prevention service.\n",
      "WHAT DOES PC-CARE LOOK LIKE?\n",
      "Each week the caregiver and child attend a 1 hour session for a total of 7 weeks (including 1 pre-treatment assessment and behavior observation and 6 weeks of dyadic and coaching sessions). During each hour long session the provider checks in with the family, uses a brief child behavior screener to address behaviors in the past week, does a 10 minute didactic of new skills, and then coaches the caregiver for 30 minutes live in the moment to use the new skills during play with the child. At the end of the session the provider assigns “Daily CARE” to the caregiver to use the skills during play with the child for 5 minutes every day.\n",
      "WHO IS PC-CARE FOR?\n",
      "PC-CARE is for any caregiver that is motivated to improve their relationship with their child and to learn new caregiving skills. Caregivers should have custody of the child, or have at least regular contact (e.g., foster, adoptive, relative, reunited parent that has at least supervised visits). Caregivers need to be willing to spend five minutes in play with their child on a daily basis. This program is for children between the ages of 1 and 10 years who may have experienced a traumatic event, may be adjusting to a new home, or may be disruptive and defiant. PC-CARE has been adapted into a variety of protocols for a wide range of populations and needs: Spanish-speaking families, toddlers, older children, children with sexual behavior problems, children with ASD and IDD, and children with feeding problems.\n",

Founded by and for cancer survivors, NCCS is a leader in advocating for policy changes that promote quality of care and quality of life after diagnosis. NCCS strongly believes in evidence-based advocacy that reflects the needs of cancer patients to effect policy change at the national level.Survivorship is the challenge faced daily by millions of Americans who have a history of cancer. Survivorship, however, is not just about long-term survival. Instead, it is about one’s quality of life from diagnosis onward. It is living with, through, and beyond cancer.Remaining Hopeful presents a publication, \"You Have the Right to Remain Hopeful\" in order to provide general information and to serve as a resource for people experiencing a diagnosis of cancer. This resources represents the opinions of NCCS and is not designed to provide individual advice nor substitute for professional counsel. The publication addresses the following topics: • Cancer as a crisis• Cancer and fear• Remaining positive • Family hope • Hoping for health care professionalsIt is important to think about your own hoping strategies and to be direct with family, friends and professional caregivers about what is most helpful to you with regard to using and maintaining hope. Never let anyone tell you that there is nothing further to hope for or that there is no hope. There is always something to hope for, and you, as an individual, have the right to determine for what, when and how you hope.\n",
