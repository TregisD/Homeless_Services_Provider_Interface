We offer: - Educational groups- Peer Support- Health, Wellness, and Faith-Based services- Community-based Support and Learning- Individual Therapy and Crisis Support- Group Therapy- Psychiatry (Medication Management)- Co-occurring (Mental Health and Drug & Alcohol) Support- Optional Older Adult ProgramOur ultimate goal is to help a person understand that they are a valued and needed part of society. No person’s recovery journey is the same, therefore there is no standard timeframe on REC services. Scheduling is choice-driven; members choose from the “menu” of services for the days, times, and activities that best fit their personal needs. The Older Adult Program is open on Saturdays, as well.Once a person completes the REC program they are welcome to transition to our Mental Health Outpatient program. If a person wishes to attend REC, they are able to do so right away; there is no waiting time for starting REC services.We accept Medicaid insurance for all of our REC services."

Through the counseling support program, participants will be provided the guidance, expertise, and support thanks to the help of well versed licensed therapists who understand CF.This program provides:- Individual and family counselingChildren and adults with CF as well as their family members (parents, siblings, spouses/partners) are eligible to receive financial support for six individual therapy sessions per year with a licensed provider of their choice. CFRI will cover the cost of your insurance co-pay for six sessions, or pay up to $120 per session for six sessions if you have no insurance, or your provider does not accept insurance or is outside of your network.You can select a licensed therapist in your community (for a referral, you can ask your CF social worker).This program has limited funds and operates on a “first come first serve” basis. Due to high demand, the program often runs out of funding in the second half of the year. To ensure that your sessions are covered, please follow CFRI program procedures as outlined below:- Check in with CFRI staff: BEFORE sending us any invoices, contracts, or other documents, please contact Sabine Brants ([email protected], 650-665-7576) to check if there is funding available for your sessions. If CFRI has funding available, CFRI staff will send the required paperwork to you as well as your chosen provider. The paperwork provided to you needs to be completed BEFORE starting CFRI-supported sessions. - Wait for sessions to be approved: Once CFRI receives the completed paperwork from you and the provider, CFRI staff will let you know that you are approved to start your six CFRI-supported sessions. This program will not accept invoices that are submitted without prior approval.- Submit assessments and invoices: By participating in the program, you commit to take part in the brief evaluation process. At the first and last of the CFRI-supported sessions, the therapist will ask you to complete two short questionnaires, and submit them to CFRI along with the first and last invoice. Please notify CFRI immediately if you discontinue therapy for whatever reason so the money can be released and used to support other people with CF and their families.For more information on how to participate in CFRI’s Counseling Support Program, please email Sabine Brants: [email protected]."

Our goal is to help Veterans, their family members, and other loved ones find the appropriate services at their local VA facilities and/or in their community. We also provide coaching to family and friends of Veterans who see that a Veteran in their life may be having difficulty adjusting to civilian life. Coaching is provided by licensed psychologists or social workers, free-of-charge. Coaching involves helping our callers figure out how to motivate the Veteran to seek treatment. We can help you get information about mental health, services at the VA and tips on how to begin the conversation about treatment with a loved one who is a Veteran.What to expect: When you call Coaching Into Care at 888-823-7458, you will talk with a member of our team who specializes in helping callers determine the best way to help the Veteran they care about and how to navigate the VA system. Our hours of operation are Monday — Friday, from 8 AM to 8 PM (Eastern).Calls with a coach vary in length, but generally take 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the issue. Our work with you may extend for several calls and usually with the same coach.Coaching Into Care takes your privacy, and that of the Veteran, very seriously. We keep all calls confidential, except for cases in which we act to protect the lives of you, the Veteran, or others."

Our team is committed to you and will collaborate set goals aimed at processing and overcoming challenges. During your participation, you’ll build resilience, develop coping skills, reduce stress levels, and achieve goals that will improve your quality of life. Many who participate in the program also develop improved relationships with friends and loved ones. Our goal-setting model is not only beneficial while participating in the program but can be applied to daily life situations well after you have completed the program.\n\nWWP Talk is a free nonclinical, telephonic, emotional support and goal-setting program. The program helps both warriors and family members plan individualized paths toward personal growth. Participants work one-on-one with a dedicated team member during weekly emotional support calls. Together, they set tangible SMART goals and develop skills that lead to positive changes, like increased resilience, improved psychological well-being, and improved overall quality of life.\n\nTo join the program, you must first register with us. For more information or to sign up for the program, call our Resource Center at 888.WWP.ALUM (997.2586) or 904.405.1213."
