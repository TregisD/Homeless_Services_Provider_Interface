PSR offers in-person services at its office in Riverside, California, and remote services to any current resident of California. We currently offer services in both English and Spanish. PSR services are provided by pre-licensed doctoral trainees and licensed providers. The rates for pre-licensed clinicians start at or below the rates for comparable services of other mental health providers in the community. Licensed providers at PSR typically charge rates that are comparable to the going rate in the community.  Both levels have sliding fee scales, and grant funding may be available to help lower costs even further based on special circumstances.

Due to high demand, the program often runs out of funding in the second half of the year. To ensure that your sessions are covered, please follow CFRI program procedures as outlined below:- Check in with CFRI staff: BEFORE sending us any invoices, contracts, or other documents, please contact Sabine Brants ([email\u00a0protected], 650-665-7576) to check if there is funding available for your sessions. If CFRI has funding available, CFRI staff will send the required paperwork to you as well as your chosen provider. The paperwork provided to you needs to be completed BEFORE starting CFRI-supported sessions. - Wait for sessions to be approved: Once CFRI receives the completed paperwork from you and the provider, CFRI staff will let you know that you are approved to start your six CFRI-supported sessions. This program will not accept invoices that are submitted without prior approval.- Submit assessments and invoices: By participating in the program, you commit to take part in the brief evaluation process. At the first and last of the CFRI-supported sessions, the therapist will ask you to complete two short questionnaires, and submit them to CFRI along with the first and last invoice. Please notify CFRI immediately if you discontinue therapy for whatever reason so the money can be released and used to support other people with CF and their families.For more information on how to participate in CFRI\u2019s Counseling Support Program, please email Sabine Brants: [email\u00a0protected]. )\n",
