I hope they aren't receiving county funds from Riverside and if they are - they should be yanked immediately.

A friend of mine was having a mental health crisis last night and I wanted to reach out for resources and different options other than calling police or seeking a 5150 WIC hold.

While using the text-based resource seeking option, the operator asked:

""Is he in immediate danger?""

I replied,
""No""
""911, police and 5150 Wic are not necessary""

They replied,
""Then finding him a therapist"" [sic]

I asked,
""Is that a suggestion or a question""

No further responses were received. Shame on you for being rude and inconsiderate to someone seeking mental health help. Not everyone wants to call 911, have authorities in their home or be placed on a hold. Sometimes people need compassion, encouragement and help making the best decision for their mental health.

I hope that someone never finds themselves alone, seeking help and makes the terrible mistake of contacting Operation Safe House.

Disgraceful and pathetic.",1

IT SAYS VERY CLEARLY ‚ÄúOperation Safe House, with Community Support, provides Emergency Shelter, Intervention and Outreach Services to Youth in Crisis.‚Äù IT ALSO SAYS ‚ÄúProvide immediate counseling and intervention services for variable and multiple needs (inner conflict resolution, child abuse / neglect, substance abuse, etc.), 2) Reunite the youth with their family (family preservation and reunification), 3) Create an intervention point for runaway and homeless youth before they become juvenile offenders.
