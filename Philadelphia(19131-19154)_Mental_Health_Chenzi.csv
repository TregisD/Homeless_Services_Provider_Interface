Our counselors have an incredible diversity of backgrounds and life experience, they also approach coping with and overcoming challenges in diverse ways. Some focus on listening and validating, while others focus on reframing situations or solving problems. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to life. The core of peer counseling is that the relationship is based on shared experience, rather than diagnosing and treating a mental illness. We’re open and transparent about the challenges we’ve faced, so you can find someone who can relate.

We offer 30-minute online counseling sessions for just $14. This allows us to pay our counselors a living wage, while making emotional support as easy to access as possible. Sessions happen over Zoom, so they can be audio or video.

Peer Collective counselors have passed our rigorous screening and demonstrate exceptional empathy, warmth, and understanding, but are not licensed therapists and don’t diagnose or treat mental disorders.
