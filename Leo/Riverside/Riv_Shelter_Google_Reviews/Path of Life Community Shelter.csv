It serves a purpose for some but not others, mainly elderly support and handicapped access. There are many Hippa, OSHA, Fire, Building code and First Aid concerns right off the bat.

If you have asthma or breathing concerns, the cleaning solutions and air conditioner filters and dust are a problem when sleeping.

In 2 weeks I never got the care I was promised and never met with my case worker to assist with my issue.

The security treats you like you are in prison and searches your bags each entry. I find it weird that they know what you have before searching you stuff. Weird.

I got kicked out of there for refusing to let the guard search my bag over and over for brief entries and exits. He seems to get joy demeaning people including seniors and starting fights. I refused to let the guard bully me and got kicked out by management without ever meeting with staff for my goals. A big waste of time and resources.

The nutrition is a problem keeping you tired and unmotivated. Corn Dog, chips and sugar water for example. They also refused to serve me food several times so I went hungry. Bummer. The best part is when outside resources bring food in. Its way better than the breakfast for dinner option. Not good at all. Envision cold eggos waffles, hash brown and Luke warm sausages. One guy got sick and threw up in the dorm. Ridiculous.

There is a lot of fighting and tension for the elderly and things go missing at random. Need I say more?",1

The main thing is to give it all to the Lord.  Repent and accept the Jesus Christ in their  lives. God is able to do all things in the life of his people. God is a blessing to have in your life.

21/May/21 I'm here once again, being a government target individual you get treated badly. Oh but God sees all what is done unto me and everyone has to answer to the most high father God.
Whatever you don't won't done unto you, you better not do unto others. Still the same thing it's not right. I will continue to pray until God make his move. When here do hope by then people repent and give their life over to Jesus before it's too late.
Continue to do me wrong you will get to there quick.",3

Wow..i see them putting poeple back out on the streets back where they started. How is that a solution to tbe homelessness?  This organization hides behind christian organizations as a cover up for the schemes and misleading they do. This my first time in life becoming homeless and there is no real help. Thats why it still exist...sad..we need to hold these organizations accountable ...they still get state and government funding for housing people do they can get and stay rich without helping anyone.,1
