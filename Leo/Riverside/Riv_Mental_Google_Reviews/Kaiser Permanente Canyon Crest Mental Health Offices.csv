However, my experience was the complete opposite. Dr. Kim took extra time during my appointment to thoroughly understand my experiences, current challenges, and future goals. He listened attentively, clarified things that I was not aware of or didn't fully understand, gave me some life advice that truly hit the mark, and created a treatment plan that will hopefully lead to better outcomes over time.

Rather than just focusing on medication, he took a comprehensive approach, considering both my mental health and overall well-being while emphasizing the importance of thoughtful adjustments. I left feeling truly heard and cared for, far exceeding my expectations.

Shout out to Dr. Kim. Thank you for all that you do!",5

This center Im reviewing is the adolscent behavior side and from chk in to meeting to checkout was so POSITIVE.
The therpaist Patricia is immersive; kind, patient, and PROACTIVE. Very refreshing. The hispanic lady at check in was very kind and softspoken not shouting ?'s AT you, very kind. I also witnessed quite a few interactions with other walkins and patients both adult and children and the feedback is all positive! Until after9a.m. when 2 women came in to their front desk window and complained aloud about some meetings and work policies etc..they really should just focus on the work..take your gripes to mngmt.

How can that possible? That absurd!!! How can she very ready to return to work? When she is a mess. She could hardly make it at home, how you expect her to do her job. She cannot be by herself.  Is that what Kaiser Doctors are trained to do? Harming people instead of helping them. It is very disappointing.

Always get the run around. Never can see anyone within a reasonable amount of time and the follow up appointments take months. I ended up in the emergency room last night and still no resolutions or real reasons why my meds were not refillable. I have filed a grievance and still no real answers. I am so fed up with the mental health dept at Kaiser.I am off work losing money because their lack of help in a timely manner. They are not there to help!!!! They just don't seem to care.

The only way to get services faster is if you have a psychiatric emergency. What about the people who aren't at that point yet but still are in serious need of help?

My husband went in because he believes he has ADD. It took him YEARS to finally do something about it with my help because he kept procrastinating on it even though it was something he really wants to try fixing. Finally, even though I don't believe in pills for ADD I helped him make an appointment and now I wish I'd gone WITH HIM. I assumed this place would take care of him and they hadn't. They gave him medication for depression AFTER TELLING HIM HE HAS ADD! Why is he being given medication for depression? He had to go to some OTHER office to get medication! This is ridiculous we are going with Blue Cross for him now and abandoning Kaiser. I knew he shouldn't of signed up with Kaiser. Glad I work in the medical field so I can tell everyone to stay AWAY FROM KAISER INSURANCES. They don't do anything short of make a 1-2 step process a 5-7 step process just so they can bill the insurances for multiple visits.

Can't wait to walk in tomorrow and figure out how this got so screwed up.",1
