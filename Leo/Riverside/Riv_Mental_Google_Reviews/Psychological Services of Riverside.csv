Everyone was really friendly and the offices were nice... I read some of the reviews already on here before deciding I needed to write this because I cannot disagree more. My therapist was a doctoral student yes, but also already had their master's degree as well and was a licensed mft outside of the school program. Just because someone is in a program does NOT mean they don't have any experience. Does an oncologist need to have had cancer before being referred to as a good oncologist. Absolutely not, I will say that my wife and I were helped at this office and each person undoubtedly will have their own personal experience.  One point of the previous review was correct though, they do not accept insurance, but they were more than willing to work with me and my wife. Hope this helps!",5

Psychologist are just students in psyd program. They have no person to person training other than you. They only are in their second year meaning they are less than un licensed mft. Overall not very helpful in techniques of cbt and DBT.,1

But that's not what I went to them for. The paperwork I got was so riddled with errors that I cannot trust to ever use it, and after demanding my money back and being told I'd be spoken to on the matter, I was never again contacted. Don't go here, they don't even take insurance anyway.",1
