Whiteside changed my life and I will forever be grateful. The staff were always available and kind, we actually made our own meals which was nice and allowed for bonding. In this facility I began taking daily vitamins for the first time in my adult life and it's a great habit I've maintained. The only negative thing that happened to me here was I was bit by a spider on a Saturday and was treated by a staff member because the nurse wasn't there on weekends... I got a pretty substantial infection but staff took me ( and another client for an unrelated reason) to Kaiser Monday morning and a doctor promptly treated me for what he believes was a Brown Recluse bite, yikes! Anyway, the very strong antibiotics worked and I was fine. I'm sober today, more than 16 years later, because of Whiteside Manor.

they were the worst service ever ! Unprofessional ! No one checked on her for hours they forgot she was in the back house quarantine for a week till they move her in to the main house completely alone for hours .
no one was checking in for medicine or food , this facility is supposed to help her, that’s the reason she went there. They didn’t even comunícate with the staff that she was there they skipped her breakfast thinking that someone gave her breakfast but no one did .
the house owner Is rude , mean ,unprofessional she Took her plate away from her hand so she didn’t get to eat , she belittles you and talks down to you! She
Told her  “you think that your family took you here and left you there and you should feel lucky to be there ,you have no one else or no where to go.”
Teresa was also rude and bad service ,
Worst Place to go to!   They don’t help you or care you are just a pay check to them !  Especially if you are trying to recover and need the professional help the staff doesn’t know how to even check blood  pressure they couldn’t even use the machine properly.
How is this facility even open ! They should be Closed down for the terrible service !",1

This place has been the best treatment facility, in my opinion.
They took me in from the streets and they make you feel welcome.  I've learned about relapsed prevention and living in balance and education about the disease of addiction.

However the place is magical, it is the staff whom have made it the best experience for me.

The owner, Ron, although quiet and unseen, he really does care a lot about the wellbeing of the clients and staffs. What rehab let's you relax after all day of groups.

The medical staff, the only females crew that I was able to talk to. They have made my day and night so Wonderful. You see, for a gay man in an all male facility, it can be intimidating. They welcomed me with open arms and the wonderful girl talks makes it all the worth while. They care about your health and works well with the psychiatrist to working together to give you the best treatment with medication. Please, if you are struggling about taking medicine about mental health and you are think it's all bad,. I wonder what all the ""street"" drugs were made of and what harm it did with our bodies?

Bobby and Curtis and Scott and Chris:. They do the grunt work of the crew. They one of the funniest and craziest staff members. They really do care and take the time to talk to you.  Curtis makes the best food. If you are hungry; you won't be there.

John and George: the dynamic Duo. They work the graveyard. Possibly the hardest times to work do to sleep schedule. I worked graveyard before. My thanks goes out to you. Thank you for being there for us when we were having trouble sleeping.

The case workers: Jim, Brian, Thon, Mac, Antionio and Harry and (boy)George. They are the best counselors anyone can ask for. They work hard for you to give you the best treatment.

Anne-Michelle, the honorable resident therapist. She has this Wonderful way of getting things real and getting things mindful to your therapy. I've found my spirituality with her since I am a huge fan of refuge recovery.  Whatever secrets you are holding onto. Look at the moon and let it go!

My counselor Gil, I would totally recommend him for the LGBT community. He has shown me what it's meant to be a healthy and happy and an age appropriate gay man. The missing link for me was another gay man showing me the right way.   As an LGBT, we are a dying group. It's time to take a stand and fight together as a community against death and shame and bias. I'm very proud to call him my counselor.

If you ever are struggling, over and over. Just get help and ask for Whiteside Manor.  Give yourself the kindest and most beautiful thing you can do for yourself.

Thank you very much Whiteside for saving my life.",5

This place put my life back on track and did for me what the previous two rehabs I went to failed to do. The staff is wonderful, friendly, and caring. The housing is great, the meals are excellent, and the fun activities they let you do on fridays are amazing. I attended this place for two months about a year ago. I had one brief relapse since I left but was able to recover quickly and now I am nine months clean and sober and counting. Thank you Whiteside for getting my life back on track!",5

I attended the facility on Janet Street, which unfortunately now has closed.  But I am still sober four years later.  Sandi and Debbie were instrumental in my early recovery.  The strict rules and no B.S. approach were absolutely necessary.  I am fortunate that Whiteside gave me a hand up, and helped me save my life.  I am grateful for Anna, Sandi, Debbie and Ron.",5

Everybody was very nice. I donated some billiards equipment.  I wasn't ready to stop so in the last week I went and got what I needed.
Advice:
Show up early to meals. (It's not that they run out. It's that Curtis isn't always there and they stop serving food about 15 min past meal time.)
They give you a flat sheet, a fitted sheet, a pillow and a pillow case.
You receive a book of rules which is a waste of paper in my opinion.
You get a couple books and depending on your assigned counselor some packets to fill out.
Since you are a willing participate you agree to several rules.
Your not supposed to have a cell phone, unless the wind is blowing from NW to SE... I brought 2 phone old and new. .. gave them old... I checked it out each day to avoid suspension. ..
You either smoke or vape... very few people in between.
I could write so much more. .. positive and negative.
If you have questions let me know....",2
