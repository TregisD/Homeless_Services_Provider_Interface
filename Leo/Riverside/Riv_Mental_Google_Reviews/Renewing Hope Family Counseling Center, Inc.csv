I will say coming to this facility, Communication is key. Communicating with them about your needs and your lifestyle, so that they can better service you. I have been a little disappointed about their group services, but their 101 services are phenomenal. I think it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that therapy is a journey and you‚Äôre not going to get along with every therapist, so if you‚Äôre not getting along with your therapist, my recommendation would be to let them know immediately so that they can change your therapist. No facility for therapy is perfect and that includes this one. However, I will say that the staff does their absolute best to accommodate you when you needed and to meet you somewhere in the middle so that you can keep your therapy sessions and get your meds. Consistency is definitely key at this facility. The more you commit to your sessions, the more they commit to you.",5

Instead of compassion I was met with the rude attitude as though I was not in medical duress but assumed to be watching Oprah or otherwise.Through my tears and emotional state I realized my (Therapist) Deserae Leanna Quezada
Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Lic # 95180 had no concern about my medical health at that moment and was more worried about her calendar. Of course I requested to be reassigned to a new therapist and the representative who assisted me recommended Mary Stevens due to her character and integrity of understanding as she witnessed first hand as a colleague of Mary‚Äôs. In addition this representative shared that her relative has Lupus like myself but I have Chronic Respiratory Failure as well. She thought I would be a great fit as a patient with Mary so I booked an appointment. A few hours later I get a call from Leticia claiming to be the Clinical Director who informed me that per Deserae Leanna Quezada
Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Lic # 95180‚Ä¶I WAS BEING DISCHARGED FOR THERAPEUTIC SERVICES because I couldn‚Äôt participate in the video appointment today and in violation of attendance policy. If this isn‚Äôt the MOST DISCRIMINATORY action by a medical provider in my opinion then I don‚Äôt know what is!!! I was told that I was to give 48 hour notice to cancel and my past missed sessions where we couldn‚Äôt see or hear one another that had nothing to do with me, I was giving NO WARNING ABOUT BEING AT RISK OF DISCHARGE and please note that the claimed Clinical Director stated on the phone call that THEY OFFER NO ACCOMMODATIONS TO THEIR PATIENTS IN ACCORDANCE TO THE ATTENDANCE POLICY and I assume the rest as well. My missed appointments were all medical related, the others were cancelled due to their own system portal issues on several occasions. I‚Äôm chronically ill with Systemic Lupus and Chronic Respiratory Failure that comes with FLARE UPS at any given moment. So when it came close to my appointment today I‚Äôm grasping to breath while on oxygen and realize that I will NOT BE ABLE TO TALK A FULL HOUR to be further at risk so I calked and had my daughter to take over because I couldn't breath and talk sufficiently. When my daughter asked how does a patient who is chronically ill have a sudden flare up the day and/or time of set appointment give a cancellation or 48hr notice? Of course she couldn‚Äôt answer that question and NOR COULD THE CLAIMED CLINICAL DIRECTOR, LETICIA. Remember I was assigned a new therapist and then a few hours later discharged FROM THERAPY ONLY but I could REMAIN WITH MY PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. Hmm‚Ä¶If I in fact violated the attendance policy then why do you want to keep me as a patient for any services? AGAIN, why didn‚Äôt you notify me of potentially being discharged before the SUDDEN discharge date? That didn‚Äôt happen by chance it was MANIPULATIVE and DELIBERATE to CTOA (Cover There Own A*^). Deserae, LCSW was put in check by my daughter in my defense for being bullied by her and could NOT HANDLE THE HEAT nor ANSWER THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION:
How does a patient who is chronically ill have a sudden flare up the day and/or time of set appointment give a cancellation or 48hour notice???
I don‚Äôt want another patient especially if they are chronically ill with flare ups to go through the emotional duress which further impacted my mental health that caused me to have a major anxiety attack that further exacerbated my respiratory breathing problems. I did my due diligence by filing a IEHP grievance against them and I will file against them with Medi-Cal , Medicare, ADA and pursue legal action like I did so with the Housing Authority for not abiding by ADA accommodations!

I had an appointment with a nurse practitioner. I don't remember¬†her name at this point because it¬†was several days ago (after thinking about it I decided to write a review). She had short¬†hair.

At some point, I even felt that she was making fun of what I was saying while¬†speaking about something that was a sensitive¬†matter for me (she literally ironically laughed). That is just one example.

I tried to do my best to keep going with the appointment and be professional (yes, me, because I am respectful¬†by nature) but I couldn't believe some of the things she said or mentioned about what I was sharing.",1
