The first day we were there we were greeted by the director who was very welcoming and all staff was always friendly. The first thing I noticed was the cleanliness of the place and how it never smelled. That’s a big deal when entering a care facility. The place is well kept. My mom had the beginnings of a bed sore on her lower back from her recent stay at a hospital and when she was transferred to Arlington Gardens they immediately started treatment and  they got it healed within 2 weeks. She also has Parkinson’s and beginnings of dementia and that is a big worry for me because she forgets often. They always kept her safe . Everytime I would pop up at all different times to visit she was always clean and comfortable. From my experience mom’s nurses were great . The person though who really has my heart is Crystal from social services. She went above and beyond not only in helping me to understand my options for care after my mom left with them but she worked really hard to actually follow through and help me transfer her to a long term facility to continue to receive proper care for her needs. She was so personable from day 1 and always got back to any questions I had even though some days she was super busy. She helped me when nobody else did and for that I’m so thankful. People need to remember no care center is perfect. There are all different people from all walks of life with different levels of care needs. Not every day is going to be perfect. If you are able to check in on your family member you should and not place all responsibility on staff. They seem to be doing their best here in my experience and I’d definitely recommend them.,5

I was greeted inside with a smiling young lady who was very kind and caring. Even though it was after visiting hours, once I finished filling out paperwork, I was allowed to go to her room. As I walked to her room, it was like a luxury hotel with vibrant purple and gold carpet. I was so impressed at how clean everything was. When I got to my daughter's room, she was already settled in bed with a food tray!! She was given a lot of attention from doing therapy, monitoring her vitals, assisting in showers and helping her in the bathroom. She was never alone for too long. They were constantly checking on her to see how she was, if she needed something or just stopping in to say hi! They are so professional and caring. Each and every employee was super friendly and always smiling! I was especially impressed with the fact that the people caring for her were Certified Nursing Assistants.

He was at another facility for 10 days after his hospital stay, and I did not care for the original facility he was in and it was very far away.  The day I realized he could be transferred I stopped by Arlington Gardens and inquired about openings and was immediately given a tour and I received a call from Amanda in Admissions within a few minutes after leaving.   The Admissions department was amazing.  I was able to get him transferred to Arlington Gardens the same afternoon I first inquired about availability.

I was at this facility A LOT.  I was there at least 2 times daily and sometimes 3 times during my father's stay, so I was able to witness a lot.

The facility is beautiful, clean, smells clean.  The staff are friendly and they didn't seem stressed out or unhappy (unlike the previous facility).   I was greeted each time I entered the facility (during normal hours) at the front desk.

The Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy departments I feel are really top-notch at this facility.   I saw them go above and beyond with many patients, and my father.  I was allowed to go to therapy with him, and saw how they pushed him to do as much as possible, while being careful for his well-being.

My father was hospitalized twice during his stay, and Amanda in admissions worked closely with me to help ensure he had a room when he was discharged from the hospital.  The transportation service AG used was on-time and pleasant the one time we used that service.

I took my dad to more than one doctor's appointment during his stay, and as long as I let them know in advance, his nurses prepared packets carefully for his appointment, and were very accommodating to make sure we made it safely to our transportation.   Concerns that I addressed with the LVN/Charge nurse were addressed to my satisfaction.

I really appreciate the care that the CNA's, LVN's, RN's, housekeeping, maintenance, and dietary/kitchen, Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy gave my father during his stay.  As I said, I was there very frequently, and I dealt personally with every department, and they were all always accommodating of our requests.  If another time comes that my dad needs to be facility I will want him to go back to AG.",5

The caregivers were nice and easy to work with and we as a family were hands in and had a lot of demands.  For the most part they met the demands. However on my mother's discharge day Arlington Gardens messed up big time. I came to the facility the night before her discharge to finish cleaning out her room and recap the next day plans which my mother has a very important doctor's appointment which took months to get. When the transportation arrived she wasn't ready she was still in bed wet and undressed, well they dress her horribly and sent her out in the poring rain, she was late for the doctor's appointment and they would not take her.

After my investigation I was told by a day Change nurse that know one knew she was leaving.  The facility doesn't have follow through.  My mother's appointment got set by several weeks and I had to beg her physician to give us a 30 day supply of medicine all because of the discharge error. We will not use this facility again.

Good luck families.",2

I expected a smelly,  place with people wandering the halls unattended. I was pleasantly surprised.  Apparently, there are two wings, one is short term the other was for longer stays. I stayed in the short term wing.
Although the CNAs were sometimes understandably distracted and forgot things at times, they were always upbeat, caring, gentle and listened.  My call button was always answered in a timely manner. I never had an accident or sat in soiled sheets.  The bed was comfortable.  We were bathed twice a week and had access to soap, toothpaste,
mouthwash,  washclothes and towels.  You have the choice of having your family or the facility doing your laundry. Dr. Mistery (spelling?) came by at least once a day, sometimes more often.  He always greeted me in the hallway and didn't seem to mind when I occasionally stopped him to ask him questions about my care. He was caring and stayed to answer as many questions as I had and made sure I understood my care plan.   There was a place in the facility to get your haircut. There were daily activities available like bingo, crafts, magazines, group talk, religious activities, etc.  You have a choice whether to participate or not. There were lemonade, water, tea, punch and crackers available in the recreation room/cafeteria all day. You had the choice of eating in your room or in the cafeteria.  You could have guests in your room,  in little seating areas inside (equipped with tv which you can control),  in the rec room/cafeteria or at tables outside. The therapy people were great, they explained my treatments and answered all my questions.  I got both physical and occupational therapy each day, 5-6 times a week. As I said,  overall,  I was impressed with Arlington Gardens and wouldn't hesitate to put my mother there,  based on my stay.  I held back one star only because of a laundry mishap I had on one occasion.",4

It wasnt until my mom and aunt decided to take her out of the facility that everyone started apologizing and saying that they didnt know that my mom could stay there and they were sorry oh and once they realized that they had made up their mind on taking my grandma home they added ""WELL YOU CANT TAKE ANY OF THE DME"" my only thought on this is ""seriously???? That is the least important thing in this situation especially because we have all the dme needed in the house. That is what it takes for people to be considerate for the POAs to get angry.

My dad had a hip replacement. We were referred here and did the tour. Due to his type of insurance we were told he would have his own room, which he did get. We were also told that the food was all homemade as my dad tends to be a picky eater. While visiting him, he was given a baked potatoe and meat that was hard as a rock. We ended up bringing him his own food. Also, my dad experienced a lot of pain after PT. The nursing staff requested an X-ray to be done out of fear his hip was out of the socket. The X-ray came back normal but the pain continued. His mental state was not the same. He was experiencing confusion. I told the nurse and she said she was going to request a UTI test but didn't happen. After a week of continued confusion, he was sent to the hospital to get more tests done. Within 8 hours of being in the hospital, it was confirmed that his hip was out of the socket and he had both a blood infection and a UTI which may be contributing to the confusion.

When he called the staff to help him use the restroom, he waited up to 45 min before they helped. Being too late he had multiple accidents. From the families perspective, he was poorly taken care of.

The PT and OT staff seemed to be the only ones helpful!!! Thank them for that. Thankfully he is at the hospital and will not be returning there when he needs to go back to rehab.",1

First they kept giving her food she wouldn't and couldn't eat, whenever she pushed her button it took a long time for anyone to come and help her, after two weeks she is having a hard time swallowing.  We had a ""care meeting"" and her diet was changed but they still brought the wrong diet.  We all started bringing food in that we knew she liked.  Though she didn't eat much it was satisfying knowing she enjoyed what she had.  I was there this past Monday and noticed a lot of junk in her mouth so I got her toothbrush and used a washcloth and brought out a lot of undigested and gross looking food.  I then wiped it out again with a cold washcloth which she just wanted to suck on as her mouth and lips were dry.  To make a long story short hospice came in Wednesday and found that they had not been giving her the medicine they prescribed because one of the nurses was unsure how to measure it.  Really, a licensed nurse was uncomfortable giving a patient medication expressly prescribed by hospice.  This hospice worker also cleaned this patients mouth out again on Wednesday and it was full of junk again.
I have already filed a grievance, contacted another service who will be coming to investigate and am reporting them to the Better Business Bureau.  How they get a rating of a five through Medicaid is beyond me.  I was generous in giving a 2 rating as their are three CNA's and two RN's that appear very caring.  I would rather have a plain looking building with much better service then some gorgeous building where Case Management is always in meetings and you have to hunt down staff to care for your loved ones. Please don't let the aesthetics of the building fool you, you will regret your loved one being there and this isn't just my opinion.  There will be more opinions on here soon from another patients family.",2

Approximately, 2 yrs ago my father suffered from 2 open heart surgeries a week apart from one another. At the advise of the hospital we took him to another facility near his home. That place looked like an insane asylum...
There were several unattended mentally unstable seniors wondering the hallways alone. Some were crying profusely and others seemed to be delusional and lost. The first 24 hours there we stayed with my father and tried to look past what we saw. Until, a nurse walked in without washing her hands and had no gloves preparing to check my fathers fresh chest incision. I quickly got on the phone and did my due diligence. I asked this other horrible rehab center release my father.
We took dad to Arlington senior Care. We couldn't be happier. Everyone was very attentive and the entire hospital was very clean! Everything was conveniently in the hospital like physical therapy and doctor on call visits. They nursed him back to health in about 3 weeks. If I didn't experience the horrendous care center before I probably would have never had a full appreciation of this one. Thank you again for taking care of my father Arlington senior care center!",5

Found out the next morning he got my mom mixed up with the patient next to her, but worse yet, mom's sleeping pill meds were not given to her, they were given to the patient next to her!!   Dealing with the nurses up at the front desk is a nightmare.....on one occasion, while trying to get info about why they called me to tell me moms blood pressure had jumped sky high, we stood there for 20 mins while the ""Doctor"" (if you could call her that) and the LVN, argued back and forth about why mom computer data wasn't updated with this very important information and therefor the ""Doctor"" couldn't do anything for my mom.  When I got angry about this, one of the other nurses went over to the LVN and patted her on the back as said ""do you need chocolate"" in a sarcastic voice and then flipped her hair and said ""I need a break, I can't take this anymore"".  So unprofessional.  About this time someone came running up to the desk to say mom was having chest pains......what a BLESSING IN DISGUISE!  We got her out of there and after a short stay at Kaiser, we placed her at AFVW.  Best thing we ever did!  She is getting much better and the staff their are very caring and family friendly.  They really listen to your concerns and DO something about them!",1

We walked through the doors to find an empty front desk and women in an office chit chatting about their manicurist.  We proceeded through the ENTIRE facility and was never once asked if we needed any help.
The hallways were busy and at times conjested and cramped. (And had a weird odor)  There were several unattended call lights and the majority of the paitents were in bed, slumped over.
After walking around for over 15 mins we made it back to the front desk and asked for the actual tour.
I was heartbroken to hear during the tour that the old, run down, building directly next to the main building was actually the long term care center. It had tarps covering the roof, old swamp coolers in windows with dirty rusted window panes... the long term ""patio"" area had become the employees ""designated smoke area"" only 5 feet from their back door.
Walked out of there feeling bad for their current residents.",1
