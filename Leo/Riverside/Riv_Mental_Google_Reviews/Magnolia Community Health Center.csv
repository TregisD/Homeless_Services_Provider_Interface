It takes forever to get an appointment and to add to the frustration, half the time they call me to cancel the apt and I have to reschedule for weeks/months later. This last time was the worst. I had an appointment for my daughter set up, they called me the morning of the appointment 15 minutes before the appointment to tell me that I need to reschedule. So I did reschedule for a month later. Then they called me again to tell me that I could bring my daughter in. So I brought her in and she was assessed by Dr. Roya Amjadi, This doctor was the rudest doctor that I have ever met in my life. I had to take my daughter and walk out on the appointment before it was over. I will never be going back to this clinic again and have asked to have my children transferred to another clinic.",1

Background: I previously had a bad experience with my son with sensory issues at another dentist. It was so difficult I didn’t take him to the dentist for 2 years.

The dentist at the facility is the best pediatric dentist I have ever come across in my life. She understood my son’s issues and worked with him patiently and masterfully. She explained things well to both of us. My son thought she was hilarious too, which helped. I went in ready to advocate strongly for my son’s needs but all of my defenses were melted away by this wonderful dentist who showed so much care, understanding and expertise.

I am so thankful we found her!",5

It is purely for the doctors, and their ""care"". I have seen many doctors, PA's, etc...I even work in the medical field, so I know how certain things go. That being said, they are unable to provide you with solid answers, they are unhelpful, and that is very stressful when dealing with your health. These are providers that should ease your worries, not work your nerves. I had to get a second opinion, because I did not trust the care that I received.",1

So of course we get referred to San Bernardino and when I called then to change it they told me it was up to his insurance. So I called his insurance and they told me it was the doctor who chose San Bernardino. Now I have to deal with this horrible doctors office when all he needs is SHOES. do not go here.
