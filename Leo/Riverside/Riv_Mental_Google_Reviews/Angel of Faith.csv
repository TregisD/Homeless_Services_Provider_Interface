First, Dr. Luis cruz was extremely judgmental and very inappropriate, and aggressive. I do not recommend coming here nor signing up. Dr. Cruz was extremely unprofessional and spoke terribly about the people who are apart of the LGBTQ+ in a way that was none of his business. Please do not go or sign up for this place, Mr cruz was very unprofessional and said he personally was a social worker himself & said they are only in it for the money. Please do not sign up or come to this place.",1

I attended coparenting classes through his counseling services & received so much more clarity on how I can better my approach to coparenting with my ex. We may still falter at times, but with the tools provided in these classes, I feel more confident that we can work together to what is most beneficial for our daughter. Dr. Cruz & Carla were very professional, & made the classes enjoyable. They connected to the class with their life experiences, which really helped me open my heart and my mind to how I handle my own experiences. Dr. Cruz’s patience & calm demeanor really made me feel comfortable when I was unsure & hesitant to even begin these classes. Thank you Dr. Cruz & Carla!",5

Observe his session FIRST before signing to be his client to decide if he is qualified and suitable to handle your needs. Luis might be licensed, but beyond unprofessional and should be under review for misconduct and abuse of his license. This facility isn’t covered by insurance because it is not validated nor reviewed by the board. Listed as a place for riverside county but should be immediately removed from the list of recommended therapist. Not forthcoming with prospective clients about fees, payments accepted, and the lack of insurance coverage. Luis, the CEO and president’s main concern is financial gain. Asked for coparenting assistance and instead wraps you up in contract fees. Sessions are inappropriate because of the subjects he leads with and does not help clients with resolving their underlining issues. Beyond disappointed in this place and it should not be opened nor recommended to anyone.",1
