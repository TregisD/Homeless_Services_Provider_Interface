And with such amazing staff with most of them being in recovery, which was the ultimate goal was to meet like myinded people, especially Staff that knew exactly what we went through and what we were going through and how to overcome this disease of addiction and alcoholism, one day at a time. The only thing I have to say in a negative aspect more like a constructive criticism aspect is that I just wish that the staff would have better communication and even with the low census of clients there, they would have the right amount of staff on Site to bring us to meetings and stuff like that and have more groups and stuff like that, other than all that, it was a truly amazing place, amazing people, amazing ownership, amazing recovery!!",5

What I‚Äôm leaving with cannot be described with just words, but to say the least I am amazed at my recovery and the hope inside of me instilled by the principles and by the people at Ten Acre Ranch. I have already recommended this program to friends of mine still struggling in their addiction. And to anyone with doubts about this program, I had them too, but with the upmost amazement they all went away slowly but surely. A special thank you to V, Valerie, Esther, Dan, Claudia, Joe, Chef Mike, Ryan, Michelle, Katarina, Mike and Yvonne. Also want to say a special thank you to Banchi who is the kindest most genuine soul I have ever met. You all have made a profound difference in my life and have made the last 30 days nothing but comfortable and wonderful. The bonds and memories made here at Ten Acre Ranch will say with me for the rest of my life. Thank you, so much for changing my life for the better. And I hope others come along to find their sobriety and theirselves here as well.",5

I started a journey to stop using meth. That journey began at 10 Acre Ranch. I can report that, largely due to their program and, no less important, my implementation of the principles and tools they provided, I had a solid foundation and was clean from my drug of choice for just shy of 15 months. Then life happened. I was in a crisis situation caused by some underlying mental health conditions that were able to be clearly diagnosed because of my sobriety. Although I did not indulge in my drug of choice, I did end up in a situation that put my overall sobriety at risk. I needed stabilization and, if needed, a transfer to an appropriate facility. Even though that turned out to be [facility name], they took me in like family, helped me stay clean from my drug of choice, and helped me stay on this path of sobriety and self-discovery. In fact, when I had nowhere to go, no one to call, and the thoughts of giving up filled my head as my old survival skills tried to kick in, I texted (didn't even call!), and within 30 minutes I was in an Uber, on my way to a safe place.
Do you need that safe place? Are you feeling like you need a break from your personal crisis? Do you feel like you don't have anywhere to go but ""dead""? Stop talking to me and talk to them. No one else is going to care and become a partner like this. After this short stay here, I now know it's not just lip service. Yvonne, Michael, and Ricky truly care about all their clients and want to see them succeed. They will help you define what success means and will, even a year later, be there to make sure you win. At least that is what my experience has been. Call them.",5

I was totally incapable of living life on life‚Äôs terms and had trouble completing even the most minuscule tasks. I knew I was going to die if I didn‚Äôt change the way I was living and quick.
A friend had told me of a rehab center and boasted of his experience there. Having been to several treatment centers in the past I scoffed. I let my guard down long enough to think, what do I have to lose. The answer was nothing. I contacted the admission coordinator and the wheels were set in motion.
From dealing with all my baggage and the trouble it took me to even get there, to getting my wife and I a Uber, answering the 30 some odd phone calls to welcoming us at the gate. The staff at 10 acre ranch let us know that they cared and they were here to help us. The admission staff was amazing, the support staff was amazing, the nurses, Dr, Case manager, therapist, group facilitators.
(The Chef is amazing, special shout out to Chef Mike for always accommodating my wife‚Äôs dietary needs, she‚Äôs vegetarian.)
Everyone treated us so good that the time between my last use and the time it took me to detox was over before I knew it and I was well on my way towards sobriety and a new life. My relationship with my wife grew.  I made fast friends with other clients. I truly felt like people actually cared.
When our time came to move into the next chapter of our sobriety I felt empowered. I also was sad to walk out the gate because I had made a second family. Thank you 10 acre ranch. I would recommend your treatment center to anyone who is struggling with addiction. Keep doing what you do there.

My decision to join this program, with the intention of breaking free from methamphetamine addiction and the cycle of relapses, has led me on an unexpected path of self-discovery and growth.

Central to this transformation are the remarkable individuals who guide us with unwavering dedication. Jamie, the adept group facilitator, and Joseph, who adeptly oversees the evening sessions, have been instrumental in my journey. During a recent session, I delved into the origins of my self-destructive tendencies rooted in childhood experiences. The program's unique philosophy underscores the fact that overcoming addiction goes beyond mere willpower; it involves acknowledging underlying issues and recognizing the triggers that fuel destructive behavior.

Unraveling the deep-seated causes of my destructive patterns, particularly when faced with success, would have been an insurmountable task without the invaluable support of the Ten Acre Ranch team. The facility offers exceptional amenities, including sumptuous meals curated by Mike, and comfortable living quarters that provide a solid four-star experience. Beyond serving as a mere group therapy setting, the program thrives as a therapeutic community. Although not all participants progress beyond the initial detox week, those who do find themselves embraced by an environment that nurtures growth, learning, and love in ways unparalleled in my experience.

This transformative journey has not only shifted my outlook on the trajectory of my life but has also underscored the significance of altering my surroundings‚Äîchanging the people, places, and things that trigger my self-destructive tendencies. The Ten Acre Ranch team has facilitated this transition seamlessly, from ensuring a smooth journey to the facility to aiding in the financial aspects of my ongoing recovery.

While the responsibility to implement coping strategies ultimately lies with each individual, the program's core mission is unmistakable: to guide us towards sobriety, eliminate toxins from our systems, untangle the reasons behind destructive choices, and foster a renewed sense of openness and growth. Bearing witness to the profound transformations in myself and my fellow participants, I wholeheartedly affirm the program's effectiveness. For those seeking a path that not only steers them through recovery but also illuminates a brighter future, Ten Acre Ranch is undoubtedly the beacon to follow.",5

The reality is it‚Äôs in the ghetto of Riverside it‚Äôs a group of abandoned duplexes that of been remodeled into a single bed rooms with window air-conditioning‚Äôs.

After my family spent $5000 for the week and the staff and treated me like such a dirt I decided it was time for me to go home. I could deal with the poor stuff with poor training, I can also deal with the terrible food and the terrible accommodations, but I cannot deal with the coeds having sex in the bums that walk up to the gate to sell dope and the staff that could care less when I told them. Please look into this place before you decide to send your family members there. There was only one staff member on the whole entire time I saw the doctor once, this place really needs to be looked over by whoever controls the regulatory system for treatment centers because of this if this Is the example of what‚Äôs out there I can understand why we have the problems we have with addiction today.I cannot stress enough the false advertisement that led me to this place.

I was concerned that my age would make worse what I already thought of as a situation too difficult for me to handle. I was angry at everyone and everything but upon arriving I was treated with love and respect by the staff. I was put at ease by being immediately made to feel a welcome part of the group. I quickly learned that this social treatment model was ideal for my situation because everyone was so strongly encouraged to form an immediate bond with one another regardless of our individual backgrounds. We were all encouraged to work on our own recovery as much together as we were individually and were given (or rather taught) the tools to complete the program successfully. Just like the 12 step programs we were exposed to, the encouragement and opportunity to succeed is there provided residents are willing to work for it. It was obvious to me that when the staff saw that I was dedicated to my own recovery they made sure I had access to every resource at their disposal...and their best resources are their people. Each of the staff brings their own specialty expertise to ""The Ranch"" and does their utmost to share it with their residents. I traveled from NJ to CA to go to 10 Acre Ranch because it was economically attractive and even back on the other side of the country I can say I made a host of lifelong friends during my stay there.  As I write this I am over two years clean and sober as a direct result of my experiences there. I encourage men from any background to strongly consider this facility because the program works. Review their website and trust that everything you see there is a huge part of their treatment model. It's all there at your disposal topped off by a successful start toward lifelong recovery.
