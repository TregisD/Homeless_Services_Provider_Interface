There is no way this place is habitable, and they get away with it because nobody cares. LAHSA won‚Äôt take complaints because they‚Äôre not ‚ÄúDMH related‚Äù‚Äîwhatever that has to do with anything. Staff refuse to answer questions, make fun of LGBTQ people, and the admin refuses to do anything about it. Every day, someone gets stabbed or punched or something, and every day, first responders are outside the door taking someone away. The case managers will exit you no matter what you say or do and they won‚Äôt revoke the notice no matter how wrong they are. This place is a walking lawsuit waiting to happen. One of the admin told me jail is better than that place and I‚Äôd like to see a jail that‚Äôs worse than this place. They really do treat us like we‚Äôre criminals here, and if you say something about it, they‚Äôll throw you out. Oh, and don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôll wait three weeks before they give you your 30 days notice so that you only have a few days left before you have to leave so you can‚Äôt make any plans to go anywhere else.
This place has to be the worst place to go for help and it‚Äôs gotten worse and worse and it‚Äôs getting worse by the second. I complain to every department I can, and nobody cares. Nobody answers. I‚Äôm 7 days away from getting exited for ‚Äúnot communicating with my case manager‚Äù and they lied to me about the reason on the notice. They lied to me about communicating with my case managers through DMH. They lie about everything and they get away with it. You‚Äôre safer on the streets than in here.

Don‚Äôt come here. That‚Äôs the only explanation needed.
For those who want the longer one:
They refuse to put me into housing navigation.
They refuse to let me sleep.
They refuse to exit the girl who got physical with me.
There‚Äôs no hot water.
The food is hamburger helper and brown lettuce with cherry tomatoes.
The staff degrade and lie to you.
Basically, they want you to fail and be completely dependent on them because they make money off every person they keep in here.",1
