I have to rate her a 5 yes a 1 for day room employees are very mean and Melisa who has been management in kitchen for five years is very rude and mean to homeless women I am speaking for all homeless women Melisa stated""she is not obligated to give second on food,""  but yet we see it given to employee's in stead of homeless women that live in the street. Also they give it for snack the next day.  I can't believe we'll we are sitting eating we witness so many donation coming in back packs full of things for women us never are given to us. I will make sure each person who donates to women's center will be told we do not get donations. Also Melisa manager of kitchen will be written up and.

There's not a lick of respect for the women in need. It's hard to give respect when the staff treats you akin to a 2nd class citizen. In order to get respect, you need to give it. The females in charge of this center need further training. Most are rude, talk down to the clients as if they were matrons in a penal institution. Don't even think about asking questions; the one that thinks she's a male is unnecessarily rude & repugnant!!! She's obviously feeling bad about self, then wants to push her BS onto others. She needs 2b fired like yesterday....
You get information that's outdated about housing, they lie like a rug. Many of the inept staff have issues of a serious magnitude & shouldn't be here.... I'd recommend others to go there & experience the ongoing nightmare for themselves... If you're 'cute', maybe your chance for housing may be a little better.... I also have credible info from a credible person that they have apartments right there up the stairs; however, the staff will not let the clients be privy to this. They're always sitting up vetting ppl, trying to take your inventory. Whom vetted them?? 😠😠
I just think it's terrible to be able to assist ppl, & you don't!!!",1
