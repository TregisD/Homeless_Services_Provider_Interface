However I been a patient with Department of Mental Health over 7 years. This is one location that truly cares about people and ones wellbeing. The front desk was my first interaction with San Fernando Valley Community Mental Health Center who then connected me with Jessica Clark and Kevin Morgan from Access center.  My chat with Kevin help me realize that continued mental health is important key element. Which can help you;
1.)Get a job
2.)Have a balance life
3.)Live alone to give a person self independence to succeed in life

Kevin is truly a gem and a wonderful person to connect with as a social worker. He is transparent, caring awesome man.  Words can not express my gratitude for Kevin's and San Fernando Valley Community Mental Health Center.",5
