It brings tears to my eyes!! Meaning hard to be at seeing my children there!!! However it was such a wonderful place for me and my family to be..when we had absolutely no where to go!! They provided food and shelter for us in 2013-2014..I remember some staff that were extremely nice and awfully mean..lol.. Cindy agreda was a great counselor!! And helped us dearly!! The one in charge was ok when she wanted to be..and most of staff was nice!! Especiallys Maria..in charge of cooking in the kitchen..I remember my daughter's birthday and her cooking for us!! And singing Happy birthday!! Just her!! That is a memory I will never forget!! Just not being able to give your child a party and roof!! and feeling like the world is on your shoulders!! Just for a stranger to care that much!! Meant Everything!! They led us to transitional
housing in Westwood!! And helped us get jobs!! In 2018 I am now on my feet working and a roof over our heads..thank you zahn .of it weren't for you .idk where we would be today .thanks to beyond shelter as well..it wasn't easy lol!! But if you follow the rules and mind your business..respect authority..and others..you will be a..ok!! They will definitely help you with getting on your feet!!!!",5

This has to be the worst place to go when you're trying to get back on your feet. They do not follow their own rules, they treat everyone like peasants, and their caseworkers will not help you. They say they will help with getting into contact with sources with Housing, Employment, and Mental Health, seeing as they have a contract with DMH (Department of Mental Health - Los Angeles). They charge the county for everything you do, down to a toilet paper roll, and yet they have no problem giving out free food to their employees from the residents cafeteria, which in-turn effects the residents. They restrict everything you would consider to be a normal function of life. In example: You cannot leave your children alone in ANY situation, including letting your child sit at a table quietly while the parents retrieve their meals. If there is a single parent situation, you must subject your child to second-hand smoke exposure in order for the parent to have a moment to themselves. I suppose they are encouraging quitting. A seasoned smoker would know that in stressful life situations, it makes quitting even harder. There is nothing for parents to do with their children in the center, but you can walk the streets of Downtown LA. There was a children's playroom, which is closed and removed all books and toys, and provides no opportunities for families to live a normal life. The staff is truly, terrible. It should be that in order for someone to retrieve a position like theirs, they should have to live the situation the residents get to experience everyday. The staff clearly doesn't care about their responsibilities or their assistance they offer during your orientation. Certain rules get more enforced over others.

A harsh reminder about this particular organization, they discriminate. It is evident in how the staff reacts to certain people. There is favoritism among the staff and residents. They know about dangerous situations some of the children are living in continually.

One thing that I really wish would resonate, the fact that these residents are put here because they need help. Imagine if you will. Your family, for whatever reason, goes homeless. Upon starting your day at Zahn house, the breakfast announcement is around 6:45AM and runs till 8. If kids have to take a bus or train to school, most kids will miss breakfast. On your way home after work/school, you have to make it back at least before 5:30PM to make it in time for Dinner. If you're late, you only have till 6 to consume your ""healthy"" meal before the staff starts to close off the cafeteria. With that in mind. What would happen if you did miss dinner. You would have to wait till 8PM to use their vending machines during snack time. If you have no money, and no means of providing a dinner for your kids, its too bad in the eyes of Zahn. Your child now has to be punished just because their parent failed to return in time, god forbid there is traffic in DTLA at 5PM. You have to let your child starve all night. That's 6PM to 6:45AM of no food.

Do you know what that does to a parent? To the point where you feel so hopeless, you wait till everyone is asleep to go into the bathroom and cry. Do you know what that does to a human being?

Ever consider what that kind of situation does to a mental health patient?

This place needs help. Real help. Not just ""caseworkers."" J&J need to leave. - you know who you are.",1
