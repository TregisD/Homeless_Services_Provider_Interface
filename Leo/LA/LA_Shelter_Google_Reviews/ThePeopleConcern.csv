We' ve been at this hotel for 2 years trying to just get our foot in the door somewhere and we would be able to afford paying full rent. All they do is work on trying to split me and my wife apart. I am also her caregiver.They try to house her in a dangerous neighborhood in another facility not an apartment without me.Then because we refused it they threw me out of the program completely. She is a vulnerable adult and she doesn't have anyone but me. They will lie about pretty much everything they tell you.I enrolled in school and they said that disqualifies me from the program. They bully people, lie to people, treat you like a loser and a drug addict even if you don't use the drugs. Then when it becomes crunch time they manage to come up with a worse situation than we already were in. They will hack years off of your life with the dump truck load of stress they have for you.Dont worry that's plenty to last you through the 2 years of digging the rut you've already been stuck in.

I have a caseworker who, I was told, referred me to TPC in order to help get me housed. They indicated that I’d get another case manager there; they’d call me in order to do an intake. When no calls came, they called again, to no avail. Maybe a month later I called through a number I googled and I was advised that they weren’t able to give me details on whether I was assigned to someone unless I knew who my caseworker spoke to. My own caseworker didn’t remember, but said she would call again. Last week, I thought I’d go there and perhaps maybe speak with someone, do an intake but, no, they only wanted to speak with a caseworker. I sent an email to their site. On the site it implies you can go there for intake however as that was not my experience,  I asked for clarification. I told them my situation and let them know that I do need help as my situation is an unsafe one. My reply said nothing of doing an intake with them. They gave me the number of HUD and resources for the aging which doesn’t have case management resources which is why I tried going there in the first place. Homelessness is difficult enough without also being turned away from resources that are supposed to be placed there to supposedly help decrease the issue.",1

The staff likes to gaslight and those who are competent to feel inadequate and their need to control everyone in a semi sedentary situation is mentally damaging to many.

Tonight it's Thanksgiving.  Wonderful donations have rolled in and from past experience we're sure that the staff member throws all donations away.

The shelters this organization serves needs a major overhaul in management.

Then I was met with a wild tone of voice from supervision like somehow I was the problem in all of this.

Confusion and poor performance is constantly and deliberately being created by these employees along with a fight and the intent to point fingers.

The lady was talking to me like I was some sort of slave. Dignity and respect is unfounded in their work ethic, along with an intent to inflict mental distress on those who are already in emergency and transitonal phases and socio-economic plights and down cycles.

The Peoples Concern has helped me in so many ways of growth and i will ever be indepted to them..but one short of their Rapid Rehousing Housing Advocate named Whitney Harvey
She has repeadely ignored and not done her outreach duties concerning checking on me monthly.She actually was not even interested in getting me housed and still has just completely abandoned me since July 2018.Since i had to complain and be literally forcefull in getting my section 8..which she embarassed me repeadely at the housing authority not being prepared at all!!..after many scoldings from Mrs.Andrews head of the division there..
Too this day iam totally lost.being new to this whole system of section 8.having severe PTSD ..acute anxiety..and Major depression..i have written a  grievance report and had meeting with Mr.Terence Lau that assured me her commitment to getting me housed.i turned in written statement to him also..but still have heard nothing from Ms.Harvey and my section 8 voucher is due to expire in 2 months.
I have not heard from her and know nothing about what my next steps are to being""#HealthyHousedSafely..
