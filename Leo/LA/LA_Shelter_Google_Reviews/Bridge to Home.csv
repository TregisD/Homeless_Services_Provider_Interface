You guys really need to get on your game. You are supposed to be there to help others. You never know who you are dealing with and could lose your license for the way that you are treating people. Read your reviews! Everyone is not lying about how you guys are treating people. Please,  wake up!!!",1

Over the past 2 months I have dealt with many issues. They needed paperwork or else I would have to leave. I gave then the paperwork the requested and they said everything is fine. Almost a month later they said that paper won't work and I needed additional paperwork. They gave me 1 day to get court documents and if I didn't I had to leave. They locked me and my kids out and I had to fix another thing they wanted if I wanted to stay. Well a few days later they said everything is fine and I dont need the paperwork at all.  For a month now I have had my service dog and Noone from staff said anything until yesterday. They once again are giving me 1 day to get the paperwork. Yet I have a appt on Moday here at the shelter to get the service papers for the dog. Yet until Monday me and my daughter have to sleep on the streets with the dog. The entire staff seems like they will do anything to have you removed from the premises.  So as of tonight my family is back on the streets until Monday when the doctor comes to the shelter and can give me the paperwork for the dog. Not 1 person that works here communicates with other staff so basically I have 5 people telling me different things I need to give them. They throw people out like trash. The apartment side for families is a prison. Can't have family visit, kids can't have any friends over at all even if it's for a hour, can't bring in anything to cook with so your forced to eat the food they have yet its all fatty greasy food most of the time so people go without eating cause they don't want fat food cause they have kids and are use to eating healthy. My daughter is never allowed to stay a night at a friend's house cause they claim that the child needs to be in the until everyday.My daughter has to be in before 10 and due to that she had to quit her job cause she wouldn't be back home until 10:40 So kids can't have any fun because they are homeless. Items in room are cheap. The shower curtain falls down everyday even when showering,  the curtains fall down daily. The case manager tells everyone on the family side other peoples business and she has a horrible attitude. If your use to prison then it's a place for you. I WAS DEPRESSED BEING HOMELESS BUT NOW MY DEPRESSION HAS BECOME WORSE, CANT FOCUS ON GETTING A PLACE CAUSE THEY DONT DO ANYTHING TO HELP AND THEY KEEP MAKING ME COME UP WITH PAPERWORK IN 1 DAY WHICH HAS GIVEN ME HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. AS FOR MY KID ITS SAD THAT THEY ARE MAKING HER SLEEP OUTSIDE FOR 5 NIGHT CAUSE WE CAN'T GET THE PAPERWORK UNTIL MONDAY FOR THE DOG. THE STAFF MADE THE APP FOR MOMDAY YET NEEDS PAPER BY TOMORROW. They don't know what they are doing here because the staff doesn't get together and make plan goals with the families. I was grateful to have a place but being threatened all the time that I have to leave I hate this place and the staff. They don't care if they make a kid sleep on the street and me being disabled having to sleep on the streets.",5
