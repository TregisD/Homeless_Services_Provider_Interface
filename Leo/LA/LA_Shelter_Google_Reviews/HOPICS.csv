They won’t even help you at all do not even try to go here it was anot a good place to go me and my children are in need homeless on the side of the road. They will not help you. They do not even give you a call back. You are in a irrelevant person to them. They won’t even help you at all do not even try to go here. It was a bad experience. I’m still homeless on the side of the road and they do not care. They do not have any place for a three person family. If you better just be one person or two people other than that they do not help. Do not waste your time at this place. They don’t even call you back when they say there’s going to call me back. It’s a waste of time and none of them have funding any of them. specially this place Whatever you do do not come here ever.,1
