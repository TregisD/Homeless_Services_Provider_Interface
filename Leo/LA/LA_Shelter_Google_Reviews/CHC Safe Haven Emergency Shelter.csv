Always made sure we ate good food. Mr Charles was a real one as well. They even had a music studio back then where we could make music and taught us how to make beats and record using protools. They even helped me get a job and my first apartment at 18. I miss those days love y’all. ❤️ This place definitely shaped who I grew up to be man the drive was real. Can’t even thank y’all enough.,5

This place is supposed to be a safe haven for the community, but it's failing miserably. They don’t respect people’s belongings, and their schedules are super confusing I always missed breakfast because schedules were different every time. I ended up having to sleep on the streets just because I didn’t make it back in time when in reality they would give a way my bed. Not sure why they hated me so much . It’s disgusting how some people still manage to abuse others, even after they’ve been through so much. Honestly, they need to fire the entire staff and bring in people who really care and aren’t just in it for the donations.",1

Worst shelter in LA while also being the most funded, money flows in but never seems to have made it to the residents. They use their Gala(Donor Dinner Event) each year to pull donations from unwitting donors, why are they unwitting you may ask, well the tales those youth are telling up on stage are tall, and in many cases were literally written by the cov staff themselves for those residents to read and make it seem like the cov has helped people, when in reality they just take individuals who are willing to go regardless of said individuals accomplishments or lack thereof.

Food was inedible at times due to in-fighting between kitchen staff that forced out the only quality cook, she was then replaced by people who regularly disregarded food safety standards, and one individual who actually knew what he was doing but was already having problems with the chef before I left. On multiple occasions the salt levels in the food made it unsafe for human consumption, yet still it was served. Luckily I had the ability to make my own meals(when staff was willing to open the kitchen that is) which was the only saving grace due to the before mentioned faults in the cafeteria, this is not the case for all or even most of the residents whom are required to eat in said cafeteria regardless of nutritional quality provided as they have no other options for food.

CEO is a flashy individual who is paid exorbitantly as he is great at pulling in the donations(not a very difficult task though given the area code), but handling abusive staff was never his worry as staff reported by multiple residents for abusing their position were simply moved to the other side of the facility and became staff at the emergency shelter section of the compound. Personally given that they were actively refusing residents lifesaving medications, calling the police would have been the appropriate action but that would hurt their image which is all they got.

Lastly and definitely not least would have to be the joy that it was spending the pandemic at the cov. I spent nearly a month in full Quarantine because residents were allowed to travel out-of-state then return to the facility with little to no enforced restrictions, these individuals tested positive after returning and within two weeks the entire facility was under city mandated Quarantine due to an outbreak. All of which happened after the facility distributed letters to all residents stating if they left the facility and traveled out of state they would no longer be allowed to return to the facility, a letter that had no merit much like the leadership at Covenant House California. These decisions though nonsensical were likely the result of complete and total incompetence of the individual in charge of health related services who was given full comand of the covid response but posses no medical certification as he is a therapist, more specifically the Clinical Director Daniel Ballin was an unacceptable choice even when simply looking at the disarray of his own mental health team, whom regularly fail to make appointments due to emergency cases constantly happening at the facility, mental health emergencies exacerbated by the incompetence of the therapeutic team, though one can't put all the blame on him as again selecting a non-medical individual to make sweeping health decisions is malicious on the part of the board. Luckily the county health officials pretty much took over health related decisions during the Quarantine so atleast for that month we were safe, but when they left things returned to cov control and again health/safety took a back seat.

If you are thinking about going to Covenant House California, please heed my warning and call around, you deserve better. Finally to potential donors, please know the residents are in need but not of your money please only give items, because money will not reach us only items ever make it through. Toiletries, clothes, food, and other goods but no money please.",1

From their Outreach team, on-site youth support staff to their management and executive directors, they facilitate a hospitable and supportive environment that fosters individual growth. People are treated as who they are or are capable of becoming, with complete dignity and respect. My favorite feature of Covenant House is that it feels like staff are ""family"" in a sense that they really care about each individual and are very organized in their day to day operations. Upper management has a very strong on-site presence to ensure operational success and ultimately, resident success!

Somebody who has a background and has done worse than I am, can store food here and do as they please throughout the times of the facility because there in a program called R.O.P,. If somebody is in Safe Haven(Crisis), They can not bring in anything even though they did not make their life miserable with the law. Crisis attendants cannot go and get dressed because if their is no 'staff' on duty they can not. The tricky word is they say staff and their is always staff present but their innerbition to be lazy and not help, makes it that 'staff' is not there. But somebody who is known for shooting or stabbing someone... can. This place has no equality at all and these people dont really want to help you. Everything they do at the Covenant House is something you can do on your own without having their help at all. Its only helpful for living and food at times but regardless they do not want to help anybody who is here because the higher officials look down on you. Every single staff believes that you have a record and that you are here because you broke many laws, but you have not, your just homeless. Parents abandoned you and just because your 18-24, they really dont want to even have you around. Most of the time, staff is on their phone, interacting with the world instead of the human beings that are here. This place brings no equality and your words truly mean nothing to them so i suggest dont come here if you feel the need to speak. They'll just restrict you and then terminate you, just so you can re-do the process and come right back. Somebody here told staff ""Im going to start recording MY OWN conversations for MY OWN safety"". He came back that night and was restricted from going to his room because he wanted to protect HIS OWN SAFETY. This place looks down on you to hurt you, not build you. Being in this facility will crush your spirits and once you leave, you will not be the same. That cover letter they put up is to make you believe they are really trying to help... in certain area's, yes, but the whole 100, no. Do not come here unless you ABSOLUTELY NEED TO. Other than that, be your own person. Because the Covenant House Staff really does not care if you succeed, just get out of their faces.",1

This shelter provides same-day shelter for any youth seeking short-term to long-term stability in a productive enviroment. Youth who enter this program are not required to live here and may leave whenever they desire. The program has a transitional housing building where youth who have followed the shelter requirments may live in an apartment as they continue to attend school or work. Covenant house is not for youth who wish to walk in and out as they please but is a place for young spirits who wish to take their feet off the sidewalk.,5
