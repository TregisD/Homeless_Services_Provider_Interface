If you really need a respite you'll get one there. Not like a ordinary shelter. Hacienda hope you get your own room and your own bed. The only thing you don't have in your room is a TV. Doesn't have a lot of rules like you have to be in by 6:00 and out by 9:00. You can stay in all day everyday if you want. It's only 2 to 3 weeks. But if you use your time lively you will truly get arrest. And I'd like to mention again the staff is amazing,5

I lived in california approximately three years, I was living on the streets at times and shelters... during my most dangerous days of despair and hopeless uncertainty i was suddenly and swiftly introduced to this wonderful place of safe oasis and peaceful blessing. The staff are absolutely the most wonderful PPL i encountered in CALIFORNIA
.. I was treated with absolute respect and felt very very safe there with my own room that was extremely nice and was able to wash clothes at no cost... the meals were fantastic..the focus groups were undeniably fun and interesting... and the manager Joanna Archangel , which whom I miss very much as she took time out to listen to the things that were bothering me and she is such a amazing soul, It was easy to open up to her ... I miss her so very very much... I wish I could have seen her and the staff one more time before I flew back east... such a blessing both times I got ti stay there were times that my life was in the most danger in CALIFORNIA and the hacuienda of hope was able to take me in during those horrific times...without them I may have been killed no doubt.. I pray joanna Archangel reads this ...I miss you so very much my dear friend... I will never forget you and may we meet again ... and to the rest of the staff I miss the big brother Claudia as well ,, very awesome and amazing man...I miss the red haired younger girl that also works there that plays ukollay and sings... such a great friend indeed... joanna Archangel-- you are a true angel of God.",5

This is literally the only place that I know of that allows you to have a room to yourself and is a clean structured and safe environment.

Although Hacienda houses men and women in a community environment for the 2 weeks that you get to stay, it's not like sober/transitional housing/retreat
s that are crazy and full of Drama.

The Hacienda is located in a gated residential area with mostly Military/Vets which aids to much structure and sense of safety.

The meals that were cooked were always good and I could even use the community kitchen to cook if I wanted the make something to eat when meals weren't being served.

Groups were also pretty fun. Bingo/Karaoke
night with Carrol and Craft night with Cindy was always on point.

I also enjoyed  2 people in particular  that I met staying there as well and I always had fun seeing them each day.",5
