Seriously, if you’re okay with being called a liar and belittled, dive right in. Let’s talk about Keisha—what a piece of work! She asked for every possible detail “to help” us after the Eaton fire but delivered absolutely nothing in return. Instead, she sent us to a hotel where nothing worked. When we asked for lightbulbs, Kevin, the manager at Oaktree, lost his cool, claiming we were asking for way too much.

To add insult to injury, Keisha canceled the room for us without any authority to do so, even though these funds were meant as donations for evacuees of the Eaton fire. She never reported the cancellation, which suggests she may have been trying to pocket the money. This lack of transparency raises serious concerns about her intentions and indicates potential misuse of funds meant for those in need.",1
