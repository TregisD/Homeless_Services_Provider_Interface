My recent experiences at this facility have been deeply troubling, and I feel compelled to share my observations in the hope that they will prompt necessary changes.

The staff at this facility, including security, have demonstrated a lack of professionalism and maturity in their interactions with clients. I have witnessed numerous instances where clients were treated with disrespect and hostility. This includes name-calling, inappropriate attitudes, and unfair treatment based on personal biases. It is particularly disheartening to see that there is no equal opportunity for women and men, and that clients with mental health issues, disabilities, or those who are elderly are not given the respect and care they deserve.

Moreover, the manner in which the facility operates is deeply flawed. Despite clients arriving early and signing in, there is no consistent or fair order in which they are attended to. It appears that personal biases influence the order of service, which is both unjust and inhumane. The staff, particularly at the front desk, seem to have the freedom to do as they please without any accountability or oversight from management.

The lack of support and inadequate assistance provided to clients is unacceptable. Many individuals have been staying at the street tents, bus, beaches, parks, alternate housing options, or any meaningful support to help them move forward in their lives. Additionally, the facility’s failure to follow safety protocols and guidelines further endangers the well-being of its residents.

It is especially concerning that donations intended to support those in need may not be used effectively to benefit the poor and homeless individuals who rely on this facility. The staff’s behavior suggests a lack of care for their roles and responsibilities, which undermines the very purpose of the Weingart Center.

I strongly urge the leadership of the Weingart Center to address these issues immediately. The current situation not only fails to support those in need but also perpetuates a cycle of neglect and mistreatment. Justice, respect, and equal treatment must be upheld for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.",1

Why? Well many think the Weingart is supposed to do it all for you. The different programs they offer are for those in need of shelter to be honest many want free shelter food etc dont want to do anything at all. Instead treat it like a hotel. People arent allowed food or cooking in rooms, not everyone cleans ! Roaches will come and then they’ll have something else to complaint about! They have a Café for everyone where they get 3 meals a day. if u don’t  like the food you’re free to get your own! Many receive SNAP! Stop whining really. You’re are not forced to stay here! They do so much for people but not all will be thankful! Bathrooms & showers are outside of rooms. They clean them everyday 2x a day. But some can’t keep them clean. Yes some have mental health issues but they offer mental health services, substance abuse treatment  and medical. Many just don’t want to work to pay rent so they go back and act poor, homeless and  complaint about everything! No matter what anyone does they don’t want to work ! Why should they ? Some transition through here and get stable housing and jobs ! Many don’t ! So when reading complaints think of them as ingrates who no matter what anyone does for them  will never be happy ! Great programs just too many unhappy people who just love to complaint, instead of taking advantage and move on to a better life. They get stuck wanting more and more . Taking it from those who really want it !  Mental health issues is big problem around these parts and so that makes it difficult to help others. .",5

She assumed that I was coming from jail as well. I have no record at all. I’ve never been arrested in life. She literally just looked at me and said these things. I called the number again while in the waiting room and spoke to the gentleman and he told me the same as before with details on how I qualify.
