One lady proceeded to ask me if I had called and I told her yes she then told the secretary to tell people NOT to bring any donations today. I was applaud she asked me to take my donations somewhere else because they were busy. I couldn't believe it, she then said well we can just give your donations to the salvation army. If I wanted to give to SA I would have. I can't believe trying to do something beneficial to others would be so difficult. I hope they dont make as hard for the actual people in need.",1

I had help from Homeless Health Care which is located down the streets from them but one of the managers from there made the call and explained my situation and in no time at all I got a call from them and i was in there for the next 3months I was safe and off the steets. But they will tell you not to try and bond and make friends which I found hard to do which also made it hard on me. The women story's they share are so heart felt and heart breaking you can't help but to form some type of bond with them but I'm finding out which doesn't last long so it would be best just to STAY FOCUS and do what's need to get you back on YOUR FEET and on YOUR OWN AGAIN!,5
