Case Managers Never Assist you with any you literally have to do everything on your own. The Housing Case Managers don‚Äôt care about you either for Example Alyssa Haney You can email her call her leave he messages on her answering machine leave messages with the front office clerk Sandra and she will never return your calls. They reject and neglect you to the point where you feel that you are better off staying with your abuser. They pick and choose who to help because I saw it with my own eyes. I feel the racism.This is the worst agency that I‚Äôve had dealt with ever I‚Äôve been trying to seek help from them since 2019 and nothing and just keep redirecting me to other agencies that don‚Äôt benefit your situation. Don‚Äôt try using this agency try to seek elsewhere. If you read a response from them saying they are willing to work with me now that I posted this. It‚Äôs a lie they are going to ignore you further because you spoke up about them.,1

A couple of weeks later she called again to follow up and was told they had no record of her calling before. She gave up and thankfully is no longer in the abusive relationship.,1
