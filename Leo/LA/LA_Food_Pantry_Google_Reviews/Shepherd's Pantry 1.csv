I had called prior to make sure we would get attended to because apparently, you can only get in some counties.  They service La County, thank God. I spoke to Joanne, and she was superhelpful and explained everything.  They have 3 locations. I also spoke to Thomas, who gave great information as well.  Hours are from 5 to 7pm. We arrived, Penny gave us a form to fill out, very helpful, and we also met Desiree, the Case Manager very pleasant and helpful as well.  I can not stress how they were great, accommodating, and customer service. They even had bikes. Hopefully, next time we can take one. üòä. In the thrift store, Daniel, he assisted us  as well as pleasant  and helped me out a lot. Most of the food we got was really good. They also have other services available.
