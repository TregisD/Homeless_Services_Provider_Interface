The food will be 2 cans of soup 1 canned tuna and 1 canned chicken and ""maybe"" a jar of peanut butter.
Keep in mind it's cold soup and no can opener! One time I got a bagel and a orange also. Try it see for yourself. I recommend being there 8:30am first 5 people in line or skip it.

Recommend Going to the OPCC for 9am bagged lunch M-F!!  Some days is better then others...

They have free mail service and showers also. It's not far like 2 blocks or so away from Salvation.
Lunch on Saterday is a microwaved dinner served around 10am. Sunday is usually a good lunch bag. Around 10am (yummy sub, Oreos, bottle watter, peanut butter crackers, fruit)
...
3pm M-F at OPCC is a FREE burger.
NO BURGER on Saterday or Sunday
It takes like 2 hours wait in the sun though not really worth it. First 20 or so in line might get 2nd burger ask though.
It's a cheeseburger at mcdonalds or a cheep-o from Jack in the box.
Sometimes instead of burgers they have other meals probably twice in a week. More then just a burger but usually not as good.
I'd 5 star OPCC
Salvation Army needs better meals and faster lines.",3

Rehabilitation services for both men and women, of which most of the funds made from sales at thrift stores goes to. Also assisting the elderly with housing, those who would be homeless otherwise. Disaster relief and shelters, all without making a point to brag to the world about helping in these ways and more. They are truly deserving of any time or resources people can donate. I sponsored the Salvation Army in my region with free
advertising, bulding awareness in the community as well as a food drive.",5
