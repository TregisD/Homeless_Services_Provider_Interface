The person that run the place is being very disrespectful and very rude that not the way you treat people. And two when people pack fruits and vegetables at the pantry I notice they don't look at them they start packing the rotten fruits and vegetables in the plastic bags people will complain about it getting rotten food
from that place when they come on Tuesday to get the bag of food and other stuff i think they need to tell the volunteers to check the fruits and vegetables before they start packing them in bag. because along time ago I br³ought
my fruits and vegetables home and when i open my bag I found some rotten fruits I and some vegetables that were no good also. I was very disappointed and I haded throw some of them away. People can get sick. And somebody told me that they found some rats turd under the shelf where they keep their cans food and also in the candies basket they found candies that were eaten by the rats.",1

I appreciate the opportunity to get food for someone that is having a hard time right now.  Most of the volunteers are very helpful and friendly.  Sometimes they even offer to pray for you.

However, they need to be more attentive to serving the two lines of cars more evenly.  They claim that one line isn't faster than another, but it's not true.
Tonight I made a mental note of the license plate of the last car in the other line (that I wasn't in) when I got in line.  That car made it through the line much faster.
So, I waited a lot longer than I would have if I had been in that line.  I pointed it out to a worker and asked her to tell a supervisor.  She agreed that they were ""off-balance"" tonight (serving one line more often than the other).
I realize that it's a free service; however, it's frustrating to see other cars coming after you and getting served first.  This has happened on other visits as well.
It's about 45 minutes to an hour total from the time I start waiting in line until I leave.  So, being served in first come, first served order would help.
SUGGESTION:  Give drivers an index card with a number on it as they arrive, then call them out in numerical order.",4
