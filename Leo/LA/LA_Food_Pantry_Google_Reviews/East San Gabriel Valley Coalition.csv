I answered the question of how I just became homeless. She assumed I said I'm disabled when I told her my former employer who is expecting me out of his house thinks I'm disabled and don't know how to do anything like cleaning.

When someone calls asking for assistance, even if it's a motel room, never tell them to stay and make it work with someone who clearly wants the person out!",1

They have a very good article on what is needed.   It was a little hard to find as I got off the freeway on 7th Ave  left on Palm,  Palm then goes into ALPERN  and it was on the right side  .   I totally missed it as I was looking for Turnbull Canyon Road.  After asking someone It was easy to find.    I took a car load of NEW ITEMS  warm clothing for men and women,  was told they needed socks  so I purchased bags of socks ,  I was told that they needed stuff to take a shower , Razors  shaving cream, deodorant ,  Tooth brushes and paste, I also purchased sanitay pads for the women and lotion , and other bathroom items  lots of  antibacterial wipes .  Its amazing how much bathroom items you can purchase for $100  at the .99 cent store. .  A friend who's husband travels  a lot for work gave me a huge bag of all the items the hotels give  you.  I felt like Santa with all my goodies.. I hope I put a smile on someones face when they  get a shower, put on a clean  new shirt,  new socks.. We take for granted these everyday  .
