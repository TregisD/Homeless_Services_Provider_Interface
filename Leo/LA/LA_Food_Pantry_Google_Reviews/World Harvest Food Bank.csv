I had a great experience.  You work with what they have.  You have to be creative with the fresh vegetables and fruit that are given to you.  I have enough food to feed two people all week for $50. That means breakfast lunch and dinner for a week.  Plus the other items I received that can be used in my home.  Like toothpaste, hand soap and antibacterial wipes.  If you haven't purchase any toothpaste, antibacterial wipes  and hand soap lately, you must don't know how much those items cost. Pretty pricey.  I was also given chicken, precooked frozen ribs and precooked frozen cubed pork.  I received so much I can't even list it all.  I don't have any complaints.  I can't wait to go again.  I expect that the fresh fruit and vegetables will change weekly which would be a great experience. Ugly fruits and vegetables are still edible and you can still have a good meal with them. The staff there were friendly, kind and helpful.
I did not have a problem with them whatsoever.  I'm a black woman",5

Most of the food was rotten and oozing with juices. The meat and milk they give is expired. I was able to find some veggies and fruits that were edible. But that didn't fill my whole chart. I would say it's not worth $50 to only be limited to the quality and what they have which isn't much of a variety. Maybe it was the time of day that I went. But either way the food was not good there. As I got home to unpack the food I thought was good, I noticed that they scratched out the expiration date for all the meat and the bread they gave me. That's a bit suspicious and I can't trust that to me that doesn't have any tag would be good either. Not sure how this place is able to give expired food out. The milk is also expired or will expire in 2 days. That's pretty ridiculous. I feel like I was robbed $50.",1

After my bank account was overdrawn by Boost Mobile for unexpected charges I found myself without food to carry me through the weekend. I googled food banks and was led to  World Harvest on Venice. I called and explained that to a lady who told me that I had to pay $50 to shop and get $300 worth of food. I told her that I could do that on the 3rd , but I didn‚Äôt have any money today and I just needed some food to carry me through the weekend.  She told me to come. I took the bus over and she gave me a half filled grocery bag with 1 pack of English muffins, 1 apple, 2 packs of red berries, 1 cup of pumpkin spice cream cheese, 4 tiny packages of pumpkin spice mini muffins and two very hard mangoes, and a can of unsweetened , dark coffee with 225 mgs  of caffeine. I was expecting at least to be given a meat, a vegetable and a starch.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I appreciate that she gave me something, but there was an abundance of ‚Äúreal‚Äù food there and I wondered why she gave me what she did. I looked at the bag and was so shocked and confused that I just took it and left. I didn‚Äôt feel good at all, but I still thanked God!
However, I  felt that that was symbolic of what she thought of me. I‚Äôm a 78 years old  Black Woman.  I showed it to a woman in a wheelchair at the bus stop. She said that she lived across the street from there for 8 years and she wasn‚Äôt surprised that I was treated as I was. I don‚Äôt know what the reason was for her to give me what she did when she had so much food and it is a charitable organization. I‚Äôm an individual and I have been known to put together a complete meal for someone else.",3

I told everyone about the place because I thought it was such a great option for affordable fresh produce.  I have been 4 times, and the first time was the best - each time after it got worse and worse.   The last time being this week when I learned that the price was increased from a $55 ""donation"" to a $75 ""donation"".   The amount of food you can put in the basket has decreased, and the price has increased.  I was really confused by this change ~ if all of this food is donated to World Harvest why did the cost of the donation to participate in the program increase so much when times are getting harder by the day?   Also, some of the other reviews are correct, there aren't a lot of food choices, the food is about 1 day from being spoiled and many times when you get it home you find mold already growing on items.  They load up your basket with items you do not want (and you are not allowed to remove them), which limits the amount of space you have to get items you do want.  I also noticed on a couple of occasions that they cater so certain customers  - bringing items from the back and placing in their baskets that are not available to all.   They use to be really friendly, but the last couple of times I have been that has also changed.   Too bad this place couldn't continue to help those in need without all the changes and manipulation.  Hope this review helps others.",2

Glen, the dedicated director, Sheila, the outstanding operations manager, and the entire staff are dedicated to ending hunger at every opportunity.

They have fresh produce, meats, fish, breads, fruit, and drinks.

We enjoy going by to see what goodies they have available; we are always blessed to come away with a car loaded down with fresh food.  Our neighbors, family and friends are thankful whenever we make our run to World Harvest, because they benefit from the food as well.

We found out Kevin from Bludsoe's also donates his delicious BBQ meats here, and it's as good as if you went directly to the restaurant üòã

L.A.'s newest mayor, Mayor Bass, has even tapped into using World Harvest in her goal of ending homelessness and hunger in the city of angels.

Everyone should make a trip to World Harvest, the work they do to end hunger is stellar.

Volunteers are needed to keep the volume of food moving.  The concept is amazing and the results could be life-changing.
Be a  part of this necessary humanitarian effort, it's awesome.

Give them a visit.

An entire grocery cart overflowing with food is only $45. If you can't afford $45. you may volunteer your time in exchange for a cart filled with groceries as well.

World Harvest collects donations from local organic farms, markets like Whole Foods, and premier restaurants as well.

If you are experiencing financial difficulties, or know someone who is having hardships putting fresh fruits and vegetables on the table, this place is a Godsend.

The staff here work very hard to put together a full cart of groceries which will be nearly filled upon your arrival. After you pay for your cart, you'll be given a stamp towards a future free cart of food and a receipt which entitles you to your ready-made cart.

From here, you can add a box or two of fresh fruit and vegetables, bread and more. I was in and out of this market with an overflowing cart in less than five minutes since all the shopping was done for me, which is extremely helpful during the pandemic.

My cart included ten pound bags of high quality produce, industrial cleaning supplies, hand sanitizers, large containers of restaurant takeout, including kimchi fried rice, and soul food from a local catering company.

I shared my cart with several friends and family members. We made dozens of meals for several families with my single cart from World Harvest.

If you want to donate to this market you can use the website for helpful instructions.

Several struggling families could participate in a single cart venture, and feed their families fresh, healthy, organic food for a very low price. Many thanks to World Harvest!",5

They over-deliver and give you even more. If you go there because of my review, let them know as I will receive another $5 as a referral gift üéÅ and so can you as well when you refer other people.
Now, if you don't have food money at all, but you have a way to get there and you live somewhere you can show proof of, there is always the option to volunteer there for 4 hours and a thank you for your time, you will receive the same full packed giant cart.

They are always closed on Sundays and on federal holidays.

Otherwise they usually close at 4PM on weekdays and 3PM on Saturdays.

During Thanksgiving they opened the morning for a few hours and closed until Friday included.

This is a reference when talking about abundance of food and cleaning supplies.

There is also the front part if the store at very discounted prices with coffee, soda, cooking oil, and much more. There are also clothes available in a rack.

This place is worth visiting with $40+ on you.
And they take debit and credit cards as well as cash without charging up for the transfer fee.",5

I asked the price on an item and they gave the same item to Mexican woman for a lower price (shady-rascism).
They also will try to give you things you don't want or need because they need to get rid of it (an entire wheel of brie cheese and 4 pounds of imitation crab meatü§£üòÇ).
Beware of the produce!!! Every time I bring home produce from this place our home is overrun by FRUIT AND PANTRY FLIESü§¨. It's insane.  Even if I wash them all before I put them away I still end up having to fog the entire house.
Lastly, you can pay $40 or work 4 hours. How is that ethical or legal when the minimum wage is $12!",2

First I was greeted by two people at the front desk who smiled and looked at me and said must be your first time. Me and my friend were hoping to get some groceries to feed some homeless people that we are friends with and hoping to also take home a little bit as well. The first explained to me how it works and they have a great sense of humor and very energetic people. After figuring out how the pricing Works 20 for the basket 40 for the cart. I loaded up the cart with groceries that I thought I could use and also easily make stuff up for the people I was helping. Not just that he give me a hand and picking out as many quality things as possible but he also added cartons of milk an extra meat, after I was finished taking the stuff out. When they say it's about $200 worth of groceries they're not kidding. Not just that but I've seen some of the reviews on here and I don't know what these people are complaining about. As a single person getting breakfast lunch and dinner just in one day. I would easily spend more than 40 bucks. So even if over half my groceries went bad in just one night, And I had to go back the next day, I would still be saving money. Just to add a little extra note, that was my experience at the very end of the night when the employees were probably extremely tired and the food probably scarce. So you can't even complain about that can you. 5 star all the way.",5

$40 dollar donation for $200 dollars worth in food! It's comparative to not having to work 7 days a week. It's like 2 days of work spared God saying, ""See I give you rest. Now go honor My day of Sabbath and even Sunday. And be ye one with family.""

Today it was, I need to get up and make $100 at some labor job at the expense of my family, but God making a way out, being YHWH Yirah, providing at the last second so I wouldn't create more stress, sorrow to my family who feels lonely and not appreciated in that I chose another weekend work than spending quality time at home.

I ""donated"" $40 (they say theyre a non profit but 2 thirds of the store's items all have prices you have to pay) for what they said was $200 to $300 of groceries. The guy running it seemed like very fake personality, treated his volunteers poorly, and made his shoppers feel stupid with a fake smile on his face. When I was done paying, he then told me that I will notice that some items say they are expired and to not worry because it's just a money-making scheme from corporations to get people to buy it quick. Little did I know, I went home, unloaded the groceries, just to find that NINETY PERCENT OF THE FOOD WAS EXPIRED. And it wasn't edible. Immediate smells when I opened most of the packages, and the food that seemed still edible I had to spit right out as soon as I tried. This place brings in low income people and homeless folks, promises them a lot of food, makes you pay an amount for a one person grocery shopping, gives you a bunch of spoiled food, and takes your money, putting you further behind financially and leaving you hungry! Listen all, you'd get more edible food spending $40 at a cheaper grocery store then coming here. PLEASE save yourself the stress and money. It is too good to be true just like it sounds.

For a small donation, I received so much food. First you start off with a cart that has a bunch of stuff in it. Ours had a case of jars of pickles underneath, a 5 lb box of sliced cheese, a couple of boxes of panda candies, some Evolution Juices, a 6 pack of organic juices, and some other items. Then we were told we should pick out produce until the cart was full and mounded up. Then we were told to grab a couple of bags of bread. After that, we were given a 5 lb. bag of Botan rice, 4 lbs of butterflied shrimp, a big pouch of imiatation crab meat, 3 big logs of fresh mozzarella, and container of Boursin cheese. Also, a pack of 6 bagels and a bag of 6 eggs.  I'm sure it's always different but this was so much food and so helpful.",5

I have volunteered once and am going back again. I worked 4 hours in exchange for a TON OF FOOD! The work is no cake walk, but well worth what you get in return.

Yes, the produce has a short life span. BUT, you get SO MUCH. The avocados, artichokes, bell peppers, romaine lettuce, and the 50 pound bag of red potatoes alone are worth more than the $30! (that's what you pay if you don't work 4 hours) BUT, THAT'S NOT ALL THE FOOD & PRODUCE YOU GET!
All this produce is donated by restaurants and markets because it is close to expiration. It would be such a waste if it was thrown away while it's still good and perfectly edible!

I filled the backseat and trunk of my friends car! 2 loafs of bread, a pack of muffins, 2 packs of dinner rolls, 2 cases of frozen food, 3 gallons of milk, snacks, sweets, cornbread stuffing, 2 cases of pico de gallo, chopped onions, prepped fresh veggies for sautee, and on, and on, plus a ton of fresh fruit and vegetables. I had more than enough to share with her as a thank you for picking me up. Additionally, I shared more with friends and neighbors and still had plenty leftover to feed myself and one other for weeks.

The negative comments are unfair. I don't believe these people are TRULY NEEDY or else they would have a better appreciation for what's available to them!",4
