The change is exceptionally helpful, as we have experienced a significant increase in the number of clients that are being referred to Counseling4Kids. Presently, our company has opportunity to provide services for clients who present with a mild-to-moderate range of symptoms. We have dedicated programs to cater to the needs of the clients which include: Stepped Care, Targeted Case Management Services, Psychological Testing Services, Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI). General Outpatient and Multi-disciplinary Assessment Team (MAT) Stepped Care: The Stepped Care Model for services allows for C4K to provide quick access to the care that our clients need. Stepped Care is a system of delivering and monitoring mental health treatment so that the most effective, yet least resource intensive treatment is delivered first, only ""stepping up"" to intensive / specialist services as required and depending on the level of client distress or need. Stepped care requires treatments of differing intensity. Thus, stepped interventions offer a variety of treatment options to match the intensity of the client's presenting problem as well as potential client preference. Targeted Case Management Services: We have a dedicated team of case managers who provide targeted case management services that help clients, and their families gain access to needed medical, social, educational and other services. Most recently our case managers have connected our families with Sandpiper Kohl's Back-to-School Shopping Event. The event supported our client's ability to return to school with greater confidence for the start of the new year. Our case managers also support our clients through skills building and medication management. Psychological and Psychiatric Testing Services: Psychologists and psychiatrists are available to support individuals who require specialized care. Our in-house psychiatric team and psychological services provide the assessments to ensure that clients receive a more intense level of service. Additionally, our psychiatric team prescribes medication as needed to our clients, which supports the efficacy of treatment. Our multidisciplinary method of treatment allows our case managers, clinicians, psychologist and psychiatrists to work together for the benefit and well-being of our clients.
