Our dynamic team of experts help vulnerable youngsters restore hope, rediscover the joy of childhood, and achieve a happier, more secure future. Our main campus, located on 17 acres of beautiful park-like grounds, includes five cottages, an arts and recreation center, a children's resource center, nursing offices for children and families, a playground, swimming pool, and a library. Three off-campus group homes provide older youth with the opportunity to develop independent living skills, job training and community experiences. Children and youth in our residential program also benefit from ""wraparound"" services that give them yet another layer of therapeutic support. With input from children and families, we partner with other agencies and resources to provide the highest quality continuum of care and ensure that each child and family reach their full potential.Los Angeles County's Residentially-Based Services program identified Hillsides as one of three agencies  to provide innovative and comprehensive services using environmentally-based and intensive treatment interventions. We transformed two Hillsides cottages from a traditional residential setting to an open therapeutic environment that is portable and can seamlessly transition children into the community, taking the residential structure, services, and staff with them.One primary goal of the program is to shorten the length of stay children may need to live away from their family and community by providing more intensive services. Each child and family has a team made up of a facilitator, a clinician, a child and family specialist and a parent partner. This team works with the family, the County, key community members, and other community supports to provide a safety net that can successfully bridge a child’s transition from the residential program into a permanent home.For more information call (323) 254-2274.",['English'],Reduced Cost,False,https://www.facebook.com/HillsidesChildren/,https://www.twitter.com/@Hillsides,"This program covers residents of the following counties: Los Angeles County, CA.",,,,False,8:00 AM - 5:00 PM  PST,8:00 AM - 5:00 PM  PST,8:00 AM - 5:00 PM  PST,8:00 AM - 5:00 PM  PST,8:00 AM - 5:00 PM  PST,Closed,Closed,,

Some focus on listening and validating, while others focus on reframing situations or solving problems. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to life. The core of peer counseling is that the relationship is based on shared experience, rather than diagnosing and treating a mental illness. We’re open and transparent about the challenges we’ve faced, so you can find someone who can relate. We offer 30-minute online counseling sessions for just $14. This allows us to pay our counselors a living wage, while making emotional support as easy to access as possible. Sessions happen over Zoom, so they can be audio or video. Peer Collective counselors have passed our rigorous screening and demonstrate exceptional empathy, warmth, and understanding, but are not licensed therapists and don’t diagnose or treat mental disorders.
