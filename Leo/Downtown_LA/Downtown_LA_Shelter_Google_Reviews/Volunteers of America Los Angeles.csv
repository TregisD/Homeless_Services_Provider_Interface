All too typical stereotype of public services literally ""low budget"" operations! Staff earns minimal $, with must be shallow training as well and that's the level of customer service... Minimal/Shallow. Poor customer; Poor value. BUT HERES THE THING... I was a homeless vet and had decided to DO THE MOST with the services provided and guess what? My experience with V of A became a blessing! Got decent housing, access to good jobs and ^ in my mental & physical health... V of A was an asset that aided me TO HELP MY SELF (!) once I decided thats what they are! Positive attitude is EVERYTHANG!!!
